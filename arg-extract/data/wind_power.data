0	Wind power in Scotland is the country's fastest growing renewable energy technology, with 2574 MW of installed capacity as of April 2011	0
1	The Robin Rigg Wind Farm is a 180 MW development completed in April 2010, which is Scotland's first offshore wind farm, sited on a sandbank in the Solway Firth	0
2	The United Kingdom's largest wind farm (322 MW) is at Whitelee in East Renfrewshire, which has a 217 MW extension under construction, set for completion in 2012	0
3	The Clyde Wind Farm is a 548 megawatt (MW) wind farm under construction near Abington in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, which will be Europe's largest onshore wind farm when completed	0
4	Two very large offshore wind turbines (5 MW each) are located in the Moray Firth	0
5	There are many other large onshore wind farms including some, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership	0
6	The siting of turbines is sometimes an issue, but surveys have shown high levels of community acceptance for wind power in Scotland	0
7	There is further potential for expansion, especially offshore given the high average wind speeds, and a number of large offshore wind farms are planned	0
8	The Scottish Government has a target of generating 31% of Scotland's electricity from renewable energy by 2011, and 100% by 2020, which was raised from 50% in September 2010	0
9	The majority of this is likely to come from wind power	0
10	Scotland's first offshore wind turbine was placed near the Beatrice Oil Field, 15 miles off the east coast in the Moray Firth, North Sea, in August 2006	0
11	This was the world's largest wind turbine at the time, an REpower 5M, with a maximum output of 5MW. A second identical turbine joined it and the wind farm began supplying electricity in August 2007	0
12	As of February 2010, Beatrice Wind Farm is the deepest and northernmost offshore wind installation in the world	0
13	This was the first time such large offshore wind turbines had been tested, and the first time any wind turbine generators have been assembled in such deep (44&nbsp;metres) water	0
14	Such large wind turbine generators are ideally suited to the offshore environment due to high consistent wind speeds and minimal turbulence	0
15	According to historical measures of wind speeds at the Beatrice offshore location, it is expected that the turbines will run 96% of the time (8440 hours per year), and at 10 MW full power 38% of the time (3300 hours per year)	0
16	The 54-turbine Black Law Wind Farm has a total capacity of 124 MW. It is located near Forth in Lanarkshire and was built on old opencast coalmine site, with an original capacity of 97 MW from 42 turbines	0
17	It employs seven permanent staff on site and created 200 jobs during construction	0
18	A second phase saw the installation of a further 12 turbines	0
19	The project has received wide recognition for its contribution to environmental objectives	0
20	Over the period April 2009 to March 2010, Black Law Wind Farm produced 19.19% of its rated capacity	0
21	The Braes of Doune Wind Farm opened in 2007 and is located close to Stirling	0
22	The wind farm has 36 Vestas 2 megawatt wind turbines	0
23	The farm was built and is run by Airtricity	0
24	Farr Wind Farm is located some 10 miles south of Inverness, and comprises 40 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 92 MW. Every year the wind farm generates enough clean electricity to meet the average annual needs of some 54,000 homes	0
25	Hadyard Hill Wind Farm, owned and operated by Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), became the first wind farm in the UK with a capacity of over 100 MW. The 120 MW, 52-turbine wind farm in South Ayrshire cost £85 million and in a year generates enough electricity to power 80,000 homes, sufficient to supply every household in a city the size of York	0
26	The production of zero carbon electricity at the wind farm is expected to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by almost 300,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to taking 70,000 cars off the road	1
27	The Robin Rigg Wind Farm is a 180 MW development completed in April 2010, which is Scotland's first offshore wind farm, sited at Robin Rigg, a sandbank midway between the Galloway and Cumbrian coasts in the Solway Firth	0
28	It has 60 Vestas V90-3MW wind turbines	0
29	The 322 MW Whitelee Wind Farm was completed ahead of schedule in May 2009	0
30	It is Europe's largest onshore wind farm, built by Scottish Power Renewables	0
31	The wind farm uses 140 Siemens 2.3-MW wind turbines	0
32	Whitelee Wind Farm has a 75 turbine extension under construction, which will add an additional 217 MW of capacity	0
33	Work on this extension is set for completion in 2012	0
34	The Clyde Wind Farm is a 548 megawatt (MW) wind farm under construction near Abington in South Lanarkshire, Scotland	0
35	When completed, it will be Europe's largest onshore wind farm	0
36	The 152-turbine project by Scottish and Southern Energy, which was approved by the Scottish Parliament in July 2008, capable of powering 320,000 homes, and will be larger than the 322 MW Whitelee Wind Farm near Glasgow	0
37	Turbines will be built either side of the M74 motorway	0
38	Construction of the wind farm, which is budgeted for £600 million, started in early 2009 and expected to finish in 2012	0
39	In January 2010 contracts were awarded for a major expansion of offshore wind power in the seas around Scotland	0
40	Moray Offshore Renewables will develop offshore wind power in the Moray Firth, and SeaGreen Wind Energy will develop offshore wind in the Firth of Forth	0
41	These developments could lead to 1,000 new wind turbines generating nearly 5,000 MW of power	0
42	Jobs "could also be created in manufacturing, research, engineering, installation, operation and services"	0
43	Most turbines in the European Union produce electricity at an average of 25% of their rated maximum power due to the variability of wind resources, but Scotland's wind regime provides average capacity factor of 40% or higher on the west and northern coasts	0
44	A small wind farm on Shetland with five Vestas V47 660&nbsp;kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over the course of a year	0
45	This record is claimed by Burradale windfarm, located just a few miles outside Lerwick and operated by Shetland Aerogenerators Ltd	0
46	Since opening in 2000, the turbines at this wind farm have had an average capacity factor of 52% and, according to this report, in 2005 averaged a world record 57.9%.   A 2011 report authored by wind farm critic Stuart Young and supported by the John Muir Trust, said that Scotland's wind farms are only delivering a fraction of the power their builders claim	0
47	The report looked at wind farm output over a 26 month period between November 2008 to December 2010 using data from the industry's Balancing Mechanism Reporting System	0
48	The report concluded that wind power "cannot be relied upon to provide significant levels of power" and "that there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the use of the energy source in future"	1
49	There was an "angry response" to the report from the energy industry, and the body representing Scotland's renewable energy refused to recognise the figures	0
50	Jenny Hogan, Director of Policy for Scottish Renewables, said: "We have no confidence in these unofficial figures", and added: "It could be argued the Trust is acting irresponsibly given their expertise lies in protecting our wild lands and yet they seem to be going to great lengths to undermine renewable energy which is widely recognised as one of the biggest solutions to tackling climate change"	0
51	An independent study investigated the JMT report by cross-referencing Renewable Obligation Certificates over the same study period and concluded that wind farms performed much better due to data problems with the BMReports website upon which the JMT Report was based	0
52	Siting of some wind turbines has become an issue amongst those concerned about the value of natural landscapes	0
53	The John Muir Trust has stated that "the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them", although even community-owned schemes can prove controversial	0
54	For example, a small-scale scheme proposed by North Harris Development Trust has been supported by the John Muir Trust	0
55	The Ardrossan Wind Farm on the west coast of Scotland has been "overwhelmingly accepted by local people"	0
56	Instead of spoiling the landscape, they believe it has enhanced the area: "The turbines are impressive looking, bring a calming effect to the town and, contrary to the belief that they would be noisy, we have found them to be silent workhorses"	0
57	Community-owned schemes in Scotland include a three V27 wind turbine system near the manufacturer Vestas's Scottish base in Kintyre, operated by Gigha Renewable Energy Ltd	0
58	which is capable of generating up to 675 kW of power	0
59	Gigha residents control the whole project and profits are reinvested in the community	0
60	Findhorn Ecovillage has four Vestas wind turbines which can generate up to 750kW. These make the community net exporters of renewably generated electricity	0
61	Most of the generation is used on-site with any surplus exported to the National Grid	0
62	Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative is part of the Energy4All group, which promotes community ownership	0
63	A number of other schemes supported by Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company are in the pipeline	0
64	A 2003 survey of residents living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found high levels of community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms	0
65	The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer the majority of their electricity to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy	1
66	A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs	1
67	When people were asked the same question in a Scottish Renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed	0
68	The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005	0
69	The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are "ugly and a blot on the landscape"	0
70	59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant	0
71	The 2010 study suggests that the opposition to wind farms is largely NIMBYism and that the majority of people in Scotland are in support of clean energy	0
72	However, concerns over inappropriate siting of turbines has been voiced by groups in Fife, in particular, where the number of planning applications for turbines has risen sharply	0
73	Some wind farms have become tourist attractions	0
74	The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room, a learning hub, a café with a viewing deck and also a shop	0
75	It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre	0
76	A proposed 400kV upgrade to the existing 132 kV transmission network, seen as key to future expansion was held up in planning for three years	0
77	There was vocal opposition from some sectors and strong support from other sectors	0
78	The proposed 220km circuit is to run from Beauly, west of Inverness to Denny, west of Falkirk	0
79	In 2008, the first major independent study associated with the Scottish Government's renewable energy targets concluded that the upgrade of the Beauly-Denny power line will be a key to future development	0
80	In January 2010, the Scottish Government approved the upgrade to the Beauly to Denny transmission line	0
81	It is estimated that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy	0
82	More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land	0
83	The total offshore potential is estimated at 25 GW, and although more expensive to install could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland	0
84	According to a recent report, the world's wind market offers many opportunities for Scottish companies, with total global revenue over the next five years estimated at £35 billion and continued growth forecast until at least 2025.	0
85	Community wind projects are locally owned by farmers, investors, businesses, schools, utilities, or other public or private entities who utilize wind energy to support and reduce energy costs to the local community	0
86	The key feature is that local community members have a significant, direct financial stake in the project beyond land lease payments and tax revenue	0
87	Projects may be used for on-site power or to generate wholesale power for sale, usually on a commercial-scale greater than 100&nbsp;kW.  Financially, community-based wind projects are structured much differently than traditional wind farms	0
88	In the traditional model, the company that builds and manages a wind farm retains sole ownership of the development	0
89	The owners of the land on which the wind turbines were built usually have no stake in development, and are instead compensated through lease payments or by royalty-based contracts	0
90	The more people that become involved through community wind power, the more democratic the energy supply system becomes	0
91	Energy sellers make a profit, landowners receive leasing fees, communities get improved infrastructure, local people get jobs, governments receive taxes, and consumers receive electricity at competitive prices	0
92	Currently, companies following a community model comprise only a small portion of the overall wind energy industry	0
93	In comparison to traditional wind companies, community wind businesses tend to develop smaller-scale projects, often less than 50&nbsp;megawatts (MW)	0
94	The Hepburn Wind Project is a wind farm at Leonards Hill near Daylesford, Victoria, north-west of Melbourne, Victoria	0
95	It comprises two 2MW wind turbines which produce enough power for 2,300 households	0
96	This is the first Australian community-owned wind farm	0
97	The initiative has emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address climate change	0
98	Community wind power is in its infancy in Canada but there are reasons for optimism	0
99	One such reason is the launch of a new Feed-in Tariff (FIT) program in the Province of Ontario . A number of community wind projects are in development in Ontario but the first project that is likely to obtain a FIT contract and connect to the grid is the Pukwis Community Wind Park	0
100	Pukwis will be unique in that it is a joint Aboriginal/Community wind project that will be majority-owned by the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, with a local renewable energy co-operative (the Pukwis Energy Co-operative) owning the remainder of the project	0
101	In Denmark, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining commune	0
102	By 2001 over 100,000 families belonged to wind turbine cooperatives, which had installed 86% of all the wind turbines in Denmark, a world leader in wind power	0
103	Wind power has gained very high social acceptance in Denmark, with the development of community wind farms playing a major role	1
104	In 1997, Samsø won a government competition to become a model renewable energy community	0
105	An offshore wind farm comprising 10 turbines (making a total of 21 altogether including land-based windmills), was completed, funded by the islanders	0
106	Now 100% of its electricity comes from wind power and 75% of its heat comes from solar power and biomass energy	0
107	An Energy Academy has opened in Ballen, with a visitor education center	0
108	In Germany, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of Germany's electricity	0
109	Wind power has gained very high social acceptance in Germany, with the development of community wind farms playing a major role	0
110	Sixty-three farmers in, the southern part of the municipality of Zeewolde, have entered into a cooperative agreement that aims to develop a wind farm of at least 108 MW. The project will include the installation of three phases of 12 wind turbines with capacities of 3 to 4.5 MW each	0
111	The aim is to put the wind farm into service in 2012	0
112	The Netherlands has an	0
113	They build and operate wind parks in all regions of the Netherlands	0
114	This started in the 1980s with the first Lagerweij turbines	0
115	Back then, these turbines could be financed by the members of the cooperatives	0
116	Today, the cooperatives build larger wind parks, but not as large as commercial parties do	0
117	Some still operate self-sufficiently, others partner with larger commercial wind park developers	0
118	Because of the very unproductive state policies for financing wind parks in the Netherlands, the cooperatives have developed a new financing model, where members of a cooperative do not have to pay taxes for the electricity they generate with their community wind park	0
119	In this construction the the cooperative operates the wind park, and a traditional energy company only acts as a service provider, for billing and energy balance on the public grid	0
120	This is the new role for energy companies in the future, where production is largely decentralized	0
121	As of 2012, there are 43 communities who are in the process of or already producing renewable energy through co-operative structures in the UK. They are set up and run by everyday people, mostly local residents, who are investing their time and money and together installing large wind turbines, solar panels, or hydro-electric power for their local communities	0
122	Baywind Energy Co-operative was the first co-operative to own wind turbines in the United Kingdom	0
123	Baywind was modeled on the similar wind turbine cooperatives and other renewable energy co-operatives that are common in Scandinavia, and was founded as an Industrial and Provident Society in 1996	0
124	It grew to exceed 1,300 members, each with one vote	0
125	A proportion of the profits is invested in local community environmental initiatives through the Baywind Energy Conservation Trust	0
126	As of 2006, Baywind owns a 2.5&nbsp;megawatt five-turbine wind farm at Harlock Hill near Ulverston, Cumbria (operational since 29 January 1997), and one of the 600&nbsp;kilowatt turbines at the Haverigg II wind farm near Millom, Cumbria	0
127	Another community-owned wind farm, Westmill Wind Farm Cooperative, opened in May 2008 in the Oxfordshire village of Watchfield	0
128	It consists of five 1.3&nbsp;megawatt turbines, and is described by its promoters as the UK's largest community-owned wind farm	0
129	It was structured as a cooperative, whose shares and loan stock were sold to the local community	0
130	Other businesses, such as Midcounties Co-operative, also invested, and the Co-operative Bank provided a loan	0
131	Community-owned schemes in Scotland include a three V27 wind turbine system near the manufacturer Vestas's Scottish base in Kintyre, operated by Gigha Renewable Energy Ltd	0
132	which is capable of generating up to 675&nbsp;kW of power	0
133	Gigha residents control the whole project and profits are reinvested in the community	0
134	Findhorn Ecovillage has four Vestas wind turbines which can generate up to 750&nbsp;kW. These make the community net exporters of renewable-generated electricity	0
135	Most of the generation is used on-site with any surplus exported to the National Grid	0
136	Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative is part of the Energy4All group, which promotes community ownership	0
137	A number of other schemes supported by Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company are in the pipeline	0
138	Unity Wind Ltd is an Industrial and Provident Society that intends to install two 2MW wind turbines at North Walsham in North Norfolk	0
139	Its key aim is installed and run by community investment and for financial benefit to the community	0
140	Most of the wind farms in the United States are commercially owned	0
141	As of 2011, Iowa has just one community owned wind farm, that is Hardin Hilltop near Jefferson, Iowa	0
142	National Wind is a large-scale community wind project developer, with thirteen families of projects in development or operation	0
143	These projects have an aggregate capacity of over 4,000 MW. The vision of the company is to revitalize rural economies by promoting investment in domestic renewable energy resources	0
144	National Wind creates shared ownership with communities and allows them participation in decisions which are made	0
145	In March 2009, National Wind formed Little Rock Wind LLC, its 7th Minnesota-based, community-owned wind energy company	0
146	The company will develop up to 150 MW of wind power within Big Stone County, Minnesota, over the next 5 to 7 years	0
147	Goodhue Wind LLC is a community wind development company in Goodhue County, Minnesota	0
148	The company intends to develop a 78 MW wind farm, which will supply electricity to Midwestern utilities and ultimately to Midwestern homes and businesses	0
149	Goodhue Wind expects the project will be operational between late 2009 and early 2010	0
150	In a community-based model, the developer/manager of a wind farm shares ownership of the project with area landowners and other community members	0
151	Property owners whose land was used for the wind farm are generally given a choice between a monthly cash lease and ownership units in the development	0
152	While some community wind projects, such as High Country Energy in southern Minnesota, issued public shares after the project's formation, investment opportunities are usually offered to local citizens before the wind development is officially created	0
153	A wind turbine cooperative, also known as a wind energy cooperative, is a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise that follows the cooperative model, investing in wind turbines or wind farms	0
154	The cooperative model was developed in Denmark	0
155	The model has also spread to Germany, the Netherlands and Australia, with isolated examples elsewhere	0
156	Some places have enacted policies to encourage development of municipally owned and operated wind turbines on town land	0
157	These projects are publicly owned and tax exempt	0
158	An example is the Hull Wind One project in Massachusetts' Boston Harbor in 2001	0
159	A 660&nbsp;kW wind turbine was installed, and is still a great example of small scale commercial wind	0
160	Wind energy projects provide adequate job opportunities, especially rural communities	0
161	Once a wind farm project is established in a community, jobs are needed for: manufacturing the materials needed to build the project, transportation of supplies to the project area, and construction of the project as well as building roads leading to the project	0
162	After the project is complete, jobs will be needed to maintain and operate the facility	0
163	According to a study by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, wind energy produces 27% more jobs per kilowatt-hour than coal plants and 66% more jobs than natural gas plants	0
164	3	0
165	Landowners will also collect revenues for hosting turbines on their property	0
166	Given a typical wind turbine spacing requirements, a 250-acre farm could increase annual farm income by $14,000 per year with little effect on their normal farming and ranching operations	0
167	4	0
168	Community wind energy projects increase local property taxes which were originally low because there was very little to be taxed due to the sparse population and vast farm land	0
169	Once the wind turbines are in service they are taxed, creating much needed revenue for the local community	0
170	The Midwest and the Great Plains regions in the United States are ideal areas for community wind energy projects; they are also oftentimes prone to drought	0
171	Fossil fuel plants use large amounts of water for cooling purposes which is detrimental to communities' water supply if there is a drought	0
172	Wind turbines do not use any water since there is no considerable amount of heat produced during energy generation	0
173	Wind energy adds power to the electric grid which decreases the amount of oil needed to generate a community's electricity	0
174	Local land owners, who produce the wind, can also control the amount of energy produced, which expands the regional energy mix	0
175	Overall community wind energy reduces the local community's dependence on oil and their cost for electricity	0
176	Wind energy is a clean energy source and does not emit greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide	1
177	Since there is no pollution, the surrounding land, water, and air is preserved	0
178	Also, since wind farms do not use any water the ecosystem may have higher survival rate	0
179	A wind turbine can be the cause of trouble when it comes to passing birds	0
180	The risk of collision with the rotors, tower, and even cables connected to a wind turbine is there and some birds are killed because of it	0
181	The annual death toll from collisions is relatively low however, the high estimate being 23 bird mortalities per turbine per year	0
182	Birds can also be disrupted by visual, noise, and vibration impacts from the wind turbines during construction and operation	0
183	This can potentially cause loss of habitat for these birds	0
184	Wind turbines also have the potential to effect the migration of birds	0
185	This can cause a problem because they have to fly further as a result, increasing chance of increased energy expenditure and the potential disruption of linkages between distant feeding, roosting, mounting and breeding areas	0
186	Bats can be affected by wind turbines as well	0
187	Two species of bats in the U.S. are the most affected by these structures, the hoary bat and the eastern red bat	0
188	It is speculated that the high frequency noise which comes from the blades and motor of the wind mill has a negative effect on the bats' echolocation, causing them to be hit by the blades	0
189	It is also said that bats can be killed by the pressure created by wind turbines	0
190	The sudden low pressure area created around the spinning blades causes a condition called barotrauma in bats when they fly through that area of drastic pressure decrease	0
191	Barotrauma occurs when one goes from normal pressure to low pressure very quickly causing the air in the lungs to expand, damaging them in the process	0
192	According to one study, barotrauma can account for as much as 50% of bat fatalities caused by wind mills	0
193	Noise Emissions is a common complaint for local citizens due to the large mechanical rotating blades	0
194	Small and medium sized wind turbines can produce noise levels up to 95 dB. This is, however, improved from old noise levels, which reached up to 120 dB.   The visual impact of wind turbines is a very controversial topic	0
195	Many find wind turbines to not be very aesthetically pleasing and consider them to be an eyesore on what should be untouched landscape	1
196	Many people are supporters of wind energy, but just do not want to be affected by it	0
197	This concept is called NIMBY, or Not In My BackYard	0
198	Like any other large structure, a wind turbine can create a very large shadow when the sun shines	0
199	When the rotor is stationary, the shadow is normal	0
200	However, when the rotor is turning, it can create a strobe effect from the rotors cutting through the sunlight	0
201	This can be very unpleasant to people in surrounding areas, such as buildings	0
202	If multiple shadows cross, this can multiply the effect to cause increased discomfort	0
203	Wind turbines have the potential to have adverse effects on tourism in certain communities that rely on their landscape to attract tourists	1
204	Many people find wind turbines to be unattractive and may be deterred from visiting a place because of that	0
205	There is also a potential for wind turbines to decrease property value in surrounding areas	0
206	A decrease is not always the case, but in certain cases, it can occur	0
207	Without a tax credit, wind energy would be an disadvantage to producers	0
208	In 1992, the renewable energy production tax credit of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour was established	0
209	In February 2009, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Congress acted to provide a three-year extension of the PTC through December 31, 2012	0
210	Wind projects that were up and running in 2009 and 2010 can choose to receive a 30% investment tax credit instead of the PTC. The investment tax credit is also an option for wind projects that are in service before 2013 if the final construction is complete before the end of 2010	0
211	Smaller wind farms (100&nbsp;kW or less) can receive a credit for 30% towards the cost of installment of the system	0
212	The ITC, written into law through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, is available for equipment installed from October 3, 2008 through December 31, 2016	0
213	The value of the credit is now uncapped, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009	0
214	In order to ensure wind energy's future in the energy market, the renewable electricity standard (RES) is a policy in which market mechanisms guarantee a growing percentage of electricity produced comes from renewable sources, like wind energy	0
215	The RES exists in 28 states (not at a national level)	0
216	An example is the Obama-Biden New Energy for America plan, which sets future goals of rapid renewable energy production at 10% by 2012	0
217	A pressing issue of concern is the lack of a modern interstate transmission grid which delivers carbon free electricity to customers	0
218	Currently the US Senate and the Natural Resources Committee have reported the bill out of committee on June 17, 2009	0
219	A combined energy and climate bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this fall	0
220	In the US House of Representatives the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a comprehensive energy and climate bill on May 21, 2010	0
221	The clean air and climate change policy is goal to switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable carbon-free energy sources for electricity production	0
222	Generating 20% of U.S. electricity from wind would be the climate equivalent of removing 140 million vehicles from the roadways	0
223	Currently the US Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works has control over the legislation and will begin to complete a markup by September 25, 2009	0
224	The House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act on June 26, 2009, comprising a provision to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050	0
225	It also allocates a portion of the allowances given away for free to energy efficiency and renewable energy	0
226	However, the allowances flow through state governments rather than directly to renewable generators	0
227	Overall federal funding for community wind research and development is insufficient and even more so when compared to other fuels and energy sources	0
228	In 2009 the US Department of Energy (DOE) received $118 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for wind energy research and development	0
229	In 2010 the Senate passed a bill granting the DOE $85 million for the DOE wind program	0
230	For the same purpose, the House of Representatives allowed the DOE $70 million.	0
231	Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor	1
232	Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources	1
233	The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months	0
234	While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use	0
235	There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures	1
236	The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances	0
237	Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines	0
238	There are anecdotal reports of negative effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines	1
239	Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these statements	0
240	Wind power consumes no fuel and no water for continuing operation, and has no emissions directly related to electricity production	1
241	Wind turbines produce no carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, radioactive waste, particulates, or any other type of air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources	1
242	Wind power plants consume resources in manufacturing and construction	0

244	The wind turbine manufacturer Vestas states that initial carbon dioxide emissions "pay back" is within about 9 months of operation for off shore turbines	0
245	emissions .   A 2006 study found the emissions of wind power to range from per GWh of energy produced	0
246	Most of the emission comes from producing the concrete for wind-turbine foundations	0
247	A study by the Irish national grid stated that "Producing electricity from wind reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and therefore leads to emissions savings", and found reductions in emissions ranging from of per MWh	1
248	The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) study of intermittency also states that wind energy can displace fossil fuel-based generation, reducing both fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions	0
249	.   Rare-earth mining pollution .   The production of permanent magnets used in some wind turbines makes use of neodymium	0
250	Primarily exported by China, pollution concerns associated with the extraction of this rare-earth element have prompted government action in recent years, and international research attempts to refine the extraction process	0
251	Research is underway on turbine and generator designs which reduce the need for neodymium, or eliminate the use of rare-earth metals altogether	0
252	However, Enercon did choose very early not to use permanent magnets for its direct drive turbines, in order to avoid responsibility in the bad environmental imprint of rare earth mining	0
253	The initial carbon dioxide emission from energy used in the installation is "paid back" within about 9 months of operation for off shore turbines	0
254	Any practical large-scale energy source must replace the energy used in its construction	0
255	The energy return on investment (EROI) for wind energy is equal to the cumulative electricity generated divided by the cumulative primary energy required to build and maintain a turbine	0
256	The EROI for wind ranges from 5 to 35, with an average of around 18, according to wind-energy advocates	0
257	EROI is strongly proportional to turbine size, and larger late-generation turbines are at the high end of this range, at or above 35	0
258	Since energy produced is several times energy consumed in construction, there is a net energy gain	0
259	Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing	0
260	The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms is minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations	1
261	If wind farms are decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition	0
262	Farmers and graziers often lease land to companies building wind farms	0
263	In the U.S., farmers may receive annual lease payments of two thousand to five thousand dollars per turbine, and wind farms may also provide additional community payments "..to reward residents who have made no financial gains [directly] from wind energy development, but whose views of.. [the] landscape now include a panorama of turbines"	0
264	The land can still be used for farming and cattle grazing	0
265	Livestock are unaffected by the presence of wind farms	0
266	International experience shows that livestock will "graze right up to the base of wind turbines and often use them as rubbing posts or for shade"	0
267	Wind-energy advocates contend that less than 1% of the land would be used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% could still be used for farming	0
268	Critics point out that the clearing of trees around tower bases may be necessary for installation sites on mountain ridges, such as in the northeastern U.S.   Turbines are not generally installed in urban areas	0
269	Buildings interfere with wind, turbines must be sited a safe distance ("setback") from residences in case of failure, and the value of land is high	0
270	There are a few notable exceptions to this	0
271	Toronto Hydro has built a lake shore demonstration project, and Steel Winds is a 20 MW urban project south of Buffalo, New York	0
272	Both of these projects are in urban locations, but benefit from being on uninhabited lake shore property	0
273	In the UK there has also been concern about the damage caused to peat bogs, with one Scottish MEP campaigning for a moratorium on wind developments on peatlands saying that "Damaging the peat causes the release of more carbon dioxide than wind farms save"	0
274	Offshore locations use no land and avoid shipping channels	0
275	Environmental assessments are routinely carried out for wind farm proposals, and potential impacts on the local environment (e.g	0
276	plants, animals, soils) are evaluated	0
277	Turbine locations and operations are often modified as part of the approval process to avoid or minimise impacts on threatened species and their habitats	0
278	Any unavoidable impacts can be offset with conservation improvements of similar ecosystems which are unaffected by the proposal	0
279	Projects such as the Black Law Wind Farm have received wide recognition for its contribution to environmental objectives, including praise from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, who describe the scheme as both improving the landscape of a derelict opencast mining site and also benefiting a range of wildlife in the area, with an extensive habitat management projects covering over 14 square kilometres	0
280	A research agenda from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, suggests modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of migratory and residential wildlife with respect to geographic features and weather, to provide a basis for science-based decisions about where to site new wind projects	0
281	More specifically, it suggests:  Use existing data on migratory and other movements of wildlife to develop predictive models of risk	0
282	Use new and emerging technologies, including radar, acoustics, and thermal imaging, to fill gaps in knowledge of wildlife movements	0
283	Identify specific species or sets of species most at risk in areas of high potential wind resoures	0
284	Causes of avian mortality in the United States, 2009  Source Estimated mortality (in thousands) . |- Wind turbines 20  . |- Nuclear powerplants 330  . |- Communication towers (radio, microwave) 4,000 - 50,000  . |- Fossil fuel powerplants 14,000  . |- Cars &#38; trucks 50,000 - 100,000  . |- Agriculture 67,000  . |- Pesticide use 72,000  . |- Building windows 97,000 - 976,000  . |- Domestic cats 100,000  . |- Hunting 100,000  . |- Feral cats 110,000  . |- Transmission Lines (conventional powerplants) 175,000 .   One study estimates that wind farms are responsible for 0.3 to 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil-fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh, although other studies have lower estimates of avian deaths	0
285	The former study therefore states that fossil fuel based electricity causes about 10 times more fatalities than wind farm based electricity, primarily due to habitat alteration from pollution and mountain-top removal for coal mining	0
286	In Denmark, where wind turbines generate 9% of electricity, wind turbines kill about 30,000 birds per year	1
287	In the United States, an unofficial non-peer-reviewed estimate by a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) scientist in 2009 claimed that wind turbines kill 440,000 birds per year, with future mortality expected to increase significantly as wind power generation expands by 2030 to levels about 12 times higher than 2009 levels	0
288	However the high figure estimated was disputed by several organizations, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service later pointed out that it was only an 'estimate' by one of many scientists, which was not being officially supported by the USFWS. In comparison, 80,000 birds are killed by aircraft, and as many as 500 million killed by cats every year	0
289	Even greater numbers of bird deaths are attributed to collisions with buildings	0
290	Other studies have stated that 57&nbsp;million are killed by cars, 97.5&nbsp;million killed by collisions with plate glass, and hundreds of millions killed by cats	0
291	An article in Nature stated that each wind turbine kills an average of 4.27&nbsp;birds per year	0
292	In the UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) concluded that "The available evidence suggests that appropriately positioned wind farms do not pose a significant hazard for birds." It notes that climate change poses a much more significant threat to wildlife, and therefore supports wind farms and other forms of renewable energy	0
293	In 2009 the RSPB warned that "numbers of several breeding birds of high conservation concern are reduced close to wind turbines," probably because "birds may use areas close to the turbines less often than would be expected, potentially reducing the carrying capacity of an area." The National Audubon Society in the U.S. takes a similar position, broadly supporting wind power to help mitigate global warming, while cautioning against siting wind farms in areas especially important to birds and other affected wildlife	0
294	Concerns have been expressed that wind turbines at Smøla in Norway are having a deleterious effect on the population of White-tailed Eagles, Europe's largest bird of prey	0
295	They have been the subject of an extensive re-introduction programme in Scotland, which could be jeopardised by the expansion of wind turbines	0
296	The Peñascal Wind Power Project in Texas is located in the middle of a major bird migration route, and the wind farm uses avian radar originally developed for NASA and the United States Air Force to detect birds as far as four miles away	0
297	If the system determines that the birds are in danger of running into the rotating blades, it shuts down the turbines	0
298	The system automatically restarts the turbines when the birds have passed	0
299	At the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California, a settlement has been reached between the Audubon Society, Californians for Renewable Energy and NextEra Energy Resources (who operate some 5,000 turbines in the area)	0
300	Nearly half of the smaller turbines will be replaced by newer, more bird-friendly models	0
301	The project is expected to be complete by 2015 and includes $2.5 million for raptor habitat restoration	0
302	Some paths of bird migration, particularly for birds that fly by night, are unknown	0
303	A study suggests that migrating birds may avoid the large turbines, at least in the low-wind non-twilight conditions studied	0
304	A Danish 2005 (Biology Letters 2005:336) study showed that radio tagged migrating birds traveled around offshore wind farms	0
305	Less than 1% of migrating birds passing an offshore wind farm in Rønde, Denmark, got close to collision, though the site was studied only during low-wind non-twilight conditions	0
306	] .   Bats may be injured by direct impact with turbine blades, towers, or transmission lines	0
307	Recent research shows that bats may also be killed when suddenly passing through a low air pressure region surrounding the turbine blade tips	0
308	The numbers of bats killed by existing onshore and near-shore facilities has troubled bat enthusiasts	0
309	A study in 2004 estimated that over 2,200&nbsp;bats were killed by 63 onshore turbines in just six weeks at two sites in the eastern U.S. This study suggests some onshore and near-shore sites may be particularly hazardous to local bat populations and more research is needed	0
310	Migratory bat species appear to be particularly at risk, especially during key movement periods (spring and more importantly in fall)	0
311	Lasiurines such as the hoary bat, red bat, and the silver-haired bat appear to be most vulnerable at North American sites	0
312	Almost nothing is known about current populations of these species and the impact on bat numbers as a result of mortality at windpower locations	0
313	It has been suggested that bats are attracted to these structures in search of roosts	0
314	Offshore wind sites or more from shore do not interact with bat populations	0
315	Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey have already conducted research using stable isotope analysis to track migration among terrestrial mammals	0
316	USGS scientists are currently applying this technique in their efforts to figure out the geographic origins of bats killed by wind turbines	0
317	In April 2009 the Bats and Wind Energy Cooperative released initial study results showing a 73% drop in bat fatalities when wind farm operations are stopped during low wind conditions, when bats are most active	0
318	Bats avoid radar transmitters, and placing microwave transmitters on wind turbine towers may reduce the number of bat collisions	0
319	Wind farms may affect weather in their immediate vicinity	0
320	Spinning wind turbine rotors generate a lot of turbulence in their wakes like the wake of a boat	0
321	This turbulence increases vertical mixing of heat and water vapor that affects the meteorological conditions downwind	0
322	Overall, wind farms lead to a warming at night and cooling during the day time	0
323	This effect can be reduced by using more efficient rotors or placing wind farms in regions with high natural turbulence	0
324	Warming at night could "benefit agriculture by decreasing frost damage and extending the growing season	0
325	Many farmers already do this with air circulators"	0
326	A number of studies have used climate models to study the effect of extremely large wind farms	0
327	One study reports simulations that show detectable changes in global climate for very high wind farm usage, on the order of 10% of the world's land area	0
328	Wind power has a negligible effect on global mean surface temperature, and it would deliver "enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of CO2 and air pollutants"	0
329	Another study published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could actually have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions	0
330	This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation	0
331	Whilst turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of . Author Ron Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study "as an argument against wind power, urging that it be used to guide future research"	0
332	"We're not pessimistic about wind," he said	0
333	"We haven't absolutely proven this effect, and we'd rather see that people do further research"	0

335	Wind turbines do not consume fuel or produce pollution during normal operation, but still have hazards associated with their construction, operation and maintenance	1
336	With the installation of industrial sized wind turbines numbering in the thousands, there have been at least 40 fatalities of workers due to the construction, operation, and maintenance of wind turbines, and other injuries and deaths attributed to the wind power life cycle	0
337	Most worker deaths involve falls or becoming caught in machinery while performing maintenance inside turbine housings	0
338	If a turbine's brake fails, the turbine can spin freely until it disintegrates or catches fire	0
339	Some turbine gondola fires cannot be extinguished because of their height, and are sometimes left to burn themselves out	0
340	In such cases they generate toxic fumes and can cause secondary fires below	0
341	Several turbine-ignited fires have burned hundreds of acres of vegetation each	0
342	However, newer wind turbines are built with automatic fire extinguishing systems similar to those provided for jet aircraft engines	0
343	The autonomous FIREX systems, which can be retrofitted to older wind turbines, automatically detect a fire, order the shut down of the turbine unit and immediately extinguish the fires completely	0
344	During winter ice may form on turbine blades and subsequently be thrown off during operation	0
345	This is a potential safety hazard, and has led to localised shut-downs of turbines	0
346	Modern turbines can detect ice formation and excess vibration during operations, and are shut down automatically	0
347	Electronic controllers and safety sub-systems monitor many different aspects of the turbine, generator, tower, and environment to determine if the turbine is operating in a safe manner within prescribed limits	0
348	These systems can temporarily shut down the turbine due to high wind, ice, electrical load imbalance, vibration, and other problems	0
349	Recurring or significant problems cause a system lockout and notify an engineer for inspection and repair	0
350	In addition, most systems include multiple passive safety systems that stop operation even if the electronic controller fails	0
351	In his book Wind Energy Comes of Age, Paul Gipe estimated that the mortality rate for wind power from 1980-1994 was 0.4 deaths per terawatt-hour	0
352	Paul Gipe's estimate as of end 2000 was 0.15 deaths per TWh, a decline attributed to greater total cumulative generation	0
353	Newer wind farms have larger, more widely spaced turbines, and have a less cluttered appearance than older installations	0
354	Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing and they coexist easily with other land uses (e.g	1
355	grazing, crops)	0
356	They have a smaller footprint than other forms of energy generation such as coal and gas plants	1
357	Wind farms may be close to scenic or otherwise undeveloped areas, and aesthetic issues are important for onshore and near-shore locations	0
358	Aesthetic issues are subjective and some people find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity	0
359	While some tourism officials predict wind farms will damage tourism, some wind farms have themselves become tourist attractions, with several having visitor centers at ground level or even observation decks atop turbine towers	1
360	Residents near turbines may complain of "shadow flicker" on nearby residences caused by rotating turbine blades, when the sun passes behind the turbine	0
361	This can easily be avoided by locating the wind farm to avoid unacceptable shadow flicker, or by turning the turbine off for the few minutes of the day when the sun is at the angle that causes flicker	0
362	Wind towers require aircraft warning lights, which may create light pollution	0
363	Complaints about these lights have caused the FAA to consider allowing fewer lights per turbine in certain areas	0
364	Modern wind turbines produce significantly less noise than older designs	0
365	Turbine designers work to minimise noise, as noise reflects lost energy and output	0
366	Noise levels at nearby residences may be managed through the siting of turbines, the approvals process for wind farms, and operational management of the wind farm	0
367	Renewable UK, a wind energy trade organization, has said that the noise measured from a wind farm is less than that from normal road traffic or in an office; some physicians and acoustic engineers have reported problems from wind turbine noise, including sleep deprivation, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and vertigo	0
368	Nina Pierpont, a New York pediatrician and wife of an anti-wind energy activist, states that noise can be an important disadvantage of wind turbines, especially when building the wind turbines very close to urban environments	0
369	The controversy around Pierpont's work centers around her statements made in a self-published, non-peer-reviewed book that ultra-low frequency sounds affect human health, which are based on a very small sample of self-selected subjects with no control group for comparison	0
370	She asserts that wind turbines affect the mood of people and may cause physiological problems such as insomnia, headaches, tinnitus, vertigo and nausea	1
371	Simon Chapman, a professor of public health, has said that "wind turbine syndrome" is not recognised by any international disease classification system and does not appear in any title or abstract in the massive US National Library of Medicine's PubMed database	0
372	He says that the term appears to be spread by the vector of anti-wind farm activist groups	0
373	In December 2006, a Texas jury denied a noise pollution suit against FPL Energy, after the company demonstrated that noise readings were not excessive	0
374	The highest reading was 44 decibels, which was characterized as about the same level as a wind	0
375	The nearest residence among the plaintiffs was from one of the turbines	0
376	More recent lawsuits have been brought in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Maine	0
377	In Ontario, Canada, the Ministry of the Environment created noise guidelines to limit wind turbine noise levels 30 metres away from a dwelling or campsite to 40 dB(A)	0
378	These regulations also set a minimum distance of for a group of up to five relatively quiet [102 dB(A)] turbines within a radius, rising to for a group of 11 to 25 noisier (106-107 dB(A)) turbines	0
379	Larger facilities and noisier turbines would require a noise study	0
380	Also in Ontario, wind farms near residential homes have attracted various protests and lawsuits from homeowners up to $1.5 million over health claims and damage to property values	1
381	A moratorium on offshore wind farms in Lake Ontario has also led to a lawsuit from Trillium Wind Power for $2.25 billion	0
382	In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach	0
383	In July 2010, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council reported that "there is no published scientific evidence to support adverse effects of wind turbines on health"	0
384	A 2008 guest editorial in Environmental Health Perspectives published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, stated: "Even seemingly clean sources of energy can have implications on human health	0
385	Wind energy will undoubtedly create noise, which increases stress, which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer." .   The Japanese Environment Ministry will begin a "major study into the influence of sounds of wind turbines on people's health" in April 2010, because "people living near wind power facilities are increasingly complaining of health problems"	1
386	They plan a four-year examination of all 1,517 wind turbines in the country	0
387	A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so	0
388	Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans	0
389	There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans	0
390	Research by Stefan Oerlemans for the University of Twente and the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory suggests that noise from existing wind turbines may be reducible by up to half by adding "saw teeth" to the trailing edges of the blades, although research is not complete	0
391	A 2009 expert panel review, described as being the most comprehensive to date, delved into the possible adverse health effects of those living close to wind turbines	0
392	Their report findings concluded that wind turbines do not directly make people ill	0
393	The 85-page study was sponsored by the Canadian Wind Energy Association and American Wind Energy Association	0
394	The academic and medical experts who conducted the study stated that they reached their conclusions independent of their sponsors	0
395	"We were not told to find anything," said panel expert David Colby, a public health officer in Chatham-Kent and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario	0
396	"It was completely open ended." .   The study did allow that some people could experience stress or irritation caused by the swishing sounds wind turbines produce	0
397	"A small minority of those exposed report annoyance and stress associated with noise perception.." [however] "Annoyance is not a disease." The study group pointed out that similar irritations are produced by local and highway vehicles, as well as from industrial operations and aircraft	0
398	The report found, amongst other things, that:  "Wind Turbine Syndrome" symptoms are the same as those seen in the general population due to stresses of daily life	0
399	They include headaches, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, etc.. low frequency and very low-frequency "infrasound" produced by wind turbines are the same as those produced by vehicular traffic and home appliances, even by the beating of people's hearts	0
400	Such 'infrasounds' are not special and convey no risk factors; Colby stated that evidence of harm was so minuscule that the wind associations were unable to initiate other independent collinear studies by government agencies	0
401	It was not surprising that their requests met with complete blanks on the need to examine the issues further; one study member noted: "You can't control the amount of cars going by and wind turbine noise is generally quieter than highway noise"; the power of suggestion, as conveyed by news media coverage of perceived 'wind-turbine sickness', might have triggered "anticipatory fear" in those close to turbine installations	0
402	The study panel members included: Robert Dobie, a doctor and clinical professor at the University of Texas, Geoff Leventhall, a noise vibration and acoustics expert in the United Kingdom, Bo Sondergaard, with Danish Electronics Light and Acoustics, Michael Seilo, a professor of audiology at Western Washington University, and Robert McCunney, a biological engineering scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology	0
403	McCunney contested statements that infrasounds from wind turbines could create vibrations causing ill health: "It doesn't really have much credence, at least based on the literature out there" he stated	0
404	In 2011, the British Acoustics Bulletin published what is now the 10th independent review of the evidence on wind farms causing annoyance and ill health in people	1
405	And for the 10th time it has emphasised that "annoyance has far more to do with social and psychological factors in those complaining than any direct effect from sound or inaudible infrasound emanating from wind turbines"	0
406	Two factors repeatedly came up	0
407	"The first is being able to see wind turbines, which increases annoyance particularly in those who dislike or fear them	0
408	The second factor is whether people derive income from hosting turbines, which miraculously appears to be a highly effective antidote to feelings of annoyance and symptoms"	0
409	Many offshore wind farms are being built in UK waters	0
410	In January 2009, a comprehensive government environmental study of coastal waters in the United Kingdom concluded that there is scope for between 5,000 and 7,000 offshore wind turbines to be installed without an adverse impact on the marine environment	0
411	The study - which forms part of the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment - is based on more than a year's research	0
412	It included analysis of seabed geology, as well as surveys of sea birds and marine mammals.	0

456	According to Simmons, a proponent of peak oil, "If we don't do this, we're going to have to evacuate most of Maine." .   As proposed, the turbines would be built on floating platforms, anchored in waters 100-200&nbsp;meters (330-660&nbsp;ft) deep — something that has never been done in the United States	0
457	It will take several years to test the feasibility of such buoyed turbines	0
458	(The Hywind wind turbine became the world's first operating large-capacity (2.3 MW) floating wind turbine in the summer of 2009, operating in the North Sea off Norway.) Hart said, "three qualities — survivability, reliability, and performance — are what investment bankers need to see before they're going to put up the large amount of capital needed"	0
459	Angus King, a former governor of Maine, is supportive of the idea."I see this as a huge economic development opportunity for Maine,.. This thing could create 20,000 to 30,000 jobs."  However, others have challenged the project's projected cost, which could reach $25&nbsp;billion	0

In 2005, Maine Mountain Power (MMP) filed an application with the Maine Land Use Regulation Committee (LURC) for a permit to develop a 30-turbine wind farm on Mount Redington () and neighboring Black Nubble ()	0
461	After years of contentious debate, the proposal was voted down by the LURC in 2007	0
462	The summit of Redington was seen as too ecologically sensitive — a sub-alpine fir habitat providing a home for two rare species, the bog lemming and Bicknell's thrush	0

542	Offshore wind power can help to reduce energy imports, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases (by displacing fossil-fuel power generation), meet renewable electricity standards, and create jobs and local business opportunities	1
543	However, according to the US Energy Information Agency, offshore wind power is the most expensive energy generating technology being considered for large scale deployment"	1
544	The advantage is that the wind is much stronger off the coasts, and unlike wind over the continent, offshore breezes can be strong in the afternoon, matching the time when people are using the most electricity	0
545	Offshore turbines can also be "located close to the power-hungry populations along the coasts, eliminating the need for new overland transmission lines"	0
546	Most entities and individuals active in offshore wind power believe that prices of electricity will grow significantly from 2009, as global efforts to reduce carbon emissions come into effect	0
547	BTM expects cost per kWh to fall from 2014, and that the resource will always be more than adequate in the three areas Europe, United States and China	0
548	The current state of offshore wind power presents economic challenges significantly greater than onshore systems - prices can be in the range of 2.5-3.0 million Euro/MW. The turbine represents just one third to one half of costs in offshore projects today, the rest comes from infrastructure, maintenance, and oversight	0
549	Larger turbines with increased energy capture make more economic sense due to the extra infrastructure in offshore systems	0
550	Additionally, there are currently no rigorous simulation models of external effects on offshore wind farms, such as boundary layer stability effects and wake effects	0
551	This causes difficulties in predicting performance accurately, a critical shortcoming in financing billion-dollar offshore facilities	0

555	Until then, state funding and pension funds will be needed	0
556	In Belfast, the harbour industry is being redeveloped as a hub for offshore windfarm construction, at a cost of about £50m	0
557	The work will create 150 jobs in construction, as well as requiring about 1m tonnes of stone from local quarries, which will create hundreds more jobs	0
558	"It is the first dedicated harbour upgrade for offshore wind"	0
559	In 2009, the average nameplate capacity of an offshore wind turbine in Europe was about 3 MW, and the capacity of future turbines is expected to increase to 5 MW.   Offshore turbines require different types of bases for stability, according to the depth of water	0

564	Conventional steel jacket structures, as used in the oil and gas industry, in water 20-80m deep	0
565	Floating wind turbines are being developed for deeper water	0
566	Turbines are much less accessible when offshore (requiring the use of a service vessel for routine access, and a jackup rig for heavy service such as gearbox replacement), and thus reliability is more important than for an onshore turbine	0
567	A maintenance organization performs maintenance and repairs of the components, spending almost all its resources on the turbines	0
568	Access to turbines is by helicopter or service access vessel	0
569	Some wind farms located far from possible onshore bases have service teams living on site in offshore accommodation units	0
570	Because of their remote nature, prognosis and health-monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines will be come much more necessary	0
571	They would enable better planning just-in-time maintenance, thereby reducing the operations and maintenance costs	0
572	According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future,making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design	0
573	Reducing this barrier would contribute to the education of engineers specializing in wind energy	0
574	The planning and permitting phase can cost more than $10 million, take 5-7 years and have an uncertain outcome	0
575	The industry puts pressure on the governments to improve the processes	0

578	Offshore wind resource characteristics span a range of spatial and temporal scales and field data on external conditions	0
579	Necessary data includes water depth, currents, seabed, migration, and wave action, all of which drive mechanical and structural loading on potential turbine configurations	0
580	Other factors include marine growth, salinity, icing, and the geotechnical characteristics of the sea or lake bed	0
581	A number of things are necessary in order to attain the necessary information on these subjects	0
582	Existing hardware fore these measurements includes Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Sonic Detection and Ranging (SODAR), radar, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), and remote satellite sensing, although these technologies should be assessed and refined, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future	0
583	Because of the previous factors, one of the biggest difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads	0
584	Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems	0
585	Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors	0
586	Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance	0
587	A 2006 Survey by the University of Delaware near the proposed Cape Wind development found that residents most frequently based their decisions to support or oppose the wind farm on perceived impacts to marine life, the environment, electricity rates, aesthetics, fishing and boating.	0
588	The environmental impact of the energy industry is diverse	0
589	Energy has been harnessed by humans for millennia	0
590	Initially it was with the use of fire for light, heat, cooking and for safety, and its use can be traced back at least 1.9 million years	0
591	In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources	0
592	In the real world, consumption of fossil fuel resources lead to global warming and climate change	0
593	However in many parts of the world little change is being made	0
594	Chinese oil demand for instance, is projected to grow nearly 20% in the next six years, and already imports over half of the it uses	0
595	If the peak oil theory proves out, and more explorations of viable alternative energy sources are made, our impact could be more friendly to the environment	0
596	Rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation, water and waste management, and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of systems ecology and industrial ecology	0
597	Global warming and climate change due to human activity is generally accepted as being caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions	0
598	The majority of greenhouses gas emissions are due to burning fossil fuels with most of the rest due to deforestation	0
599	There is a highly publicized denial of climate change but the vast majority of scientists working in climatology accept that it is due to human activity	0
600	The IPCC report Climate Change 2007: Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability predicts that climate change will cause shortages of food and water and increased risk of flooding that will affect billions of people, particularly those living in poverty	0
601	Biofuel is defined as solid, liquid or gaseous fuel obtained from relatively recently lifeless or living biological material and is different from fossil fuels, which are derived from long dead biological material	0
602	Also, various plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacturing	0
603	Bio fuels are a renewable energy and can be sustainable (carbon neutral) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions since they are in the carbon cycle for the short term	0
604	High use of bio-diesel leads to land use changes including deforestation	0
605	Unsustainable firewood harvesting can lead to loss of biodiversity and erosion due to loss of forest cover	0
606	An example of this is a 40 year study done by the University of Leeds of African forests, which account for a third of the world's total tropical forest which demonstrates that Africa is a significant carbon sink	0
607	A climate change expert, Lee White states that "To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly 5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests is at issue	0
608	According to the U.N. the continent is losing forest twice as fast as the rest of the world	0
609	"Once upon a time, Africa boasted seven million square kilometers of forest but a third of that has been lost, most of it to charcoal." .  The three fossil fuel types are coal, petroleum and natural gas	0
610	It was estimated by the Energy Information Administration that in 2006 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.8%, coal 26.6%, natural gas 22.9%, amounting to an 86% share for fossil fuels in primary energy production in the world	0
611	The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3 gigatonnes) of carbon dioxide per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon)	0
612	Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances radiative forcing and contributes to global warming, causing the average surface temperature of the Earth to rise in response, which climate scientists agree will cause major adverse effects	0
613	The environmental impact of coal mining and burning is diverse	0
614	Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990 required the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants	0
615	After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report	0
616	The environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it is toxic to almost all forms of life	0
617	The possibility of climate change exists	0
618	Petroleum, commonly referred to as oil, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities	0
619	Natural gas is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel, producing less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either coal or oil., and far fewer pollutants than other fossil fuels	0
620	However, in absolute terms it does contribute substantially to global carbon emissions, and this contribution is projected to grow	0
621	According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, in 2004 natural gas produced about 5,300 Mt/yr of CO2 emissions, while coal and oil produced 10,600 and 10,200 respectively (Figure 4.4); but by 2030, according to an updated version of the SRES B2 emissions scenario, natural gas would be the source of 11,000 Mt/yr, with coal and oil now 8,400 and 17,200 respectively	0
622	(Total global emissions for 2004 were estimated at over 27,200 Mt.) .   In addition, natural gas itself is a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere but is released in smaller amounts	0
623	The environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power	0
624	This power is normally generated at power plants that convert some other kind of energy into electrical power	0
625	Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns	0
626	The environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases	0
627	Dams and the reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water, generate hydroelectric power, increasing the water supply for irrigation, provide recreational opportunities and to improve certain aspects of the environment	0
628	However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions	0
629	Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental&mdash;to both the environment and surrounding human populations&mdash; has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that	0
630	In 1960 the construction of Llyn Celyn and the flooding of Capel Celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day	0
631	More recently, the construction of Three Gorges Dam and other similar projects throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America have generated considerable environmental and political debate	0
632	The environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle, operation, and the effects of accidents such as the Chernobyl disaster (1986) and Fukushima I nuclear accidents (2011)	0
633	Compared to the environmental effects of traditional energy sources, the environmental effects of wind power are relatively minor	1
634	Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources	1
635	The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months	0
636	While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use	0
637	Energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy consumption	0
638	Energy conservation can be achieved through increased efficient energy use, in conjunction with decreased energy consumption and/or reduced consumption from conventional energy sources	0
639	Energy conservation can result in increased financial capital, environmental quality, national security, personal security, and human comfort	0
640	Individuals and organizations that are direct consumers of energy choose to conserve energy to reduce energy costs and promote economic security	0
641	Industrial and commercial users can increase energy use efficiency to maximize profit	0
642	Energy policy is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of energy development including energy production, distribution and consumption	0
643	The attributes of energy policy may include legislation, international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for energy conservation, taxation and other public policy techniques	0
644	Sustainable energy is the provision of energy that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs	0
645	Sustainable energy sources are most often regarded as including all renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, wave power, geothermal energy, bioenergy, and tidal power	0
646	It usually also includes technologies that improve energy efficiency	0
647	Various economic instruments can be used to steer society toward sustainable energy	0
648	Some of these methods include ecotaxes and emissions trading	0
649	Ecological economics aims to address some of the interdependence and coevolution of human economies and natural ecosystems over time and space	0
650	Environmental economics, is the mainstream economic analysis of the environment, which views the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem, while ecological economics emphasis is upon preserving natural capital	0
651	.   Biophysical economics sometimes referred to as thermoeconomics is discussed in the field of ecological economics and relates directly to energy conversion, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development especially in the area of carbon burning.	0
652	Large-scale use of wind power raises many questions in integration into the existing electric power grid	0
653	Wind power is an intermittent energy source which must be used when available	1
654	If a large fraction of a system's energy is to come from wind power, provisions must be made to supply load during days with low wind	0
655	These provisions might take the form of spinning reserve already allocated in the system, start-up of stand-by power plants, or interconnections to other areas that can take up the load	0
656	Because grid operational strategies are designed for traditional dispatchable energy souces like coal, integrating wind energy into the utility grid can be problematic	1
657	Within the power grid, there must be balance between load and generation, economic and policy incentives, cost-effective storage, and robust and distributed control	0
658	In a wind farm, individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network	0
659	At a substation, this medium-voltage electrical current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system	0
660	A transmission line is required to bring the generated power to (often remote) markets	0
661	For an off-shore plant this may require a submarine cable	0
662	Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation	0
663	Induction generators, often used for wind power projects, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction	0
664	Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults (see: Low voltage ride through)	0
665	In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators	0
666	Doubly fed machines—wind turbines with solid-state converters between the turbine generator and the collector system—generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection	0
667	Transmission systems operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid	0
668	This will include power factor, constancy of frequency and dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault	0
669	] Since wind speed is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year	0
670	The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor	0
671	Typical capacity factors are 20-40%, with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favourable sites	0
672	For example, a 1MW turbine with a capacity factor of 35% will not produce 8,760 MWh in a year (1 × 24 × 365), but only 1 × 0.35 × 24 × 365&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,066&nbsp;MWh, averaging to 0.35 MW. Online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output	0
673	Unlike fueled generating plants, the capacity factor is limited by the inherent properties of wind	0
674	Capacity factors of other types of power plant are based mostly on fuel cost, with a small amount of downtime for maintenance	0
675	Nuclear plants have low incremental fuel cost, and so are run at full output and achieve a 90% capacity factor	0
676	Plants with higher fuel cost are throttled back to follow load	0
677	Gas turbine plants using natural gas as fuel may be very expensive to operate and may be run only to meet peak power demand	0
678	A gas turbine plant may have an annual capacity factor of 5-25% due to relatively high energy production cost	0
679	According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced to be used as reliable, baseload electric power, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height	0
680	Wind energy "penetration" refers to the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total available generation capacity	0
681	There is no generally accepted "maximum" level of wind penetration	0
682	The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for storage or demand management, and other factors	0
683	An interconnected electricity grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures; this reserve capacity can also serve to regulate for the varying power generation by wind plants	0
684	Studies have indicated that 20% of the total electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty	0
685	These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy, or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnection to a large grid area export of electricity when needed	0
686	Beyond this level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant	0
687	Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large (20% or more) scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics	0
688	At present, a few grid systems have penetration of wind energy above 5%: Denmark (values over 19%), Spain and Portugal (values over 11%), Germany and the Republic of Ireland (values over 6%)	0
689	The Danish grid is heavily interconnected to the European electrical grid, and it has solved grid management problems by exporting almost half of its wind power to Norway	0
690	The correlation between electricity export and wind power production is very strong	0
691	Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: from hour to hour, daily, and seasonally	1
692	Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant	0
693	Related to variability is the short-term (hourly or daily) predictability of wind plant output	0
694	Like other electricity sources, wind energy must be "scheduled"	0
695	Wind power forecasting methods are used, but predictability of wind plant output remains low for short-term operation	1
696	Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system	1
697	Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management, load shedding, or storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables	1
698	At low levels of wind penetration, fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large generating units requires reserve capacity that can also regulate for variability of wind generation	0
699	Wind power can be replaced by other power stations during low wind periods	0
700	Transmission networks must already cope with outages of generation plant and daily changes in electrical demand	0
701	Systems with large wind capacity components may need more spinning reserve (plants operating at less than full load)	0
702	A series of detailed modelling studies which looked at the Europe wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids using HVDC cables, indicates that the entire power usage could come from renewables, with 70% total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present	0
703	Intermittency would be dealt with, according to this model, by a combination of geographic dispersion to de-link weather system effects, and the ability of HVDC to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas	0
704	Pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed	0
705	Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods	0
706	The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage; the cost of storage may add 25% to the cost of any wind energy stored, but it is not envisaged that this would apply to a large proportion of wind energy generated	0
707	Thus, the 2 GW Dinorwig pumped storage plant adds costs to nuclear energy in the UK for which it was built, but not to all the power produced from the 30 or so GW of nuclear plants in the UK.   In particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power	1
708	In the US states of California and Texas, for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to air conditioning	0
709	Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient; widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds	0
710	Another option is to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC "Super grid"	0
711	In the USA it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least $60 billion	0
712	Total annual US power consumption in 2006 was 4 thousand billion kWh	0
713	Over an asset life of 40 years and low cost utility investment grade funding, the cost of $60 billion investment would be about 5% p.a	0
714	(i.e	0
715	$3 billion p.a.) Dividing by total power used gives an increased unit cost of around $3,000,000,000 × 100 / 4,000 × 1 exp9 = 0.075 cent/kWh	0
716	In the UK, demand for electricity is higher in winter than in summer, and so are wind speeds	0
717	A report from Denmark noted that their wind power network was without power for 54 days during 2002	0
718	Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness or interlinking with HVDC.   Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs to be taken into account, but it does not make the grid unmanageable; and the additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified	0
719	One way to account for intermittency is through a regional connection	0
720	If there is a sudden decrease in generation in one wind turbine or wind farm, nearby wind turbines and farms may be able to assist the grid in recovering lost frequency	0
721	Frequency controllers can extract kinetic energy from the wind turbine immediately or seconds later	0
722	This newfound capability to provide grid support may be the key to wind power's future success, according to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future	0
723	There is still need to address disparities in resources and consumption at differing locations	0
724	Investment to reinforce the connection between regional grids will offer a partial solution	0
725	Many commentators concentrate on whether or not wind has any "capacity credit" without defining what they mean by this and its relevance	0
726	Wind does have a capacity credit, using a widely accepted and meaningful definition, equal to about 20% of its rated output (but this figure varies depending on actual circumstances)	0
727	This means that reserve capacity on a system equal in MW to 20% of added wind could be retired when such wind is added without affecting system security or robustness	0
728	But the precise value is irrelevant since the main value of wind, (in the UK, worth 5 times the capacity credit value) is its fuel and CO2 savings.	0
729	The cost of electricity generated by different sources is a calculation of the cost of generating electricity at the point of connection to a load or electricity grid	0
730	It includes the initial capital, return on investment, as well as the costs of continuous operation, fuel, and maintenance	0
731	The cost is normally stated in units of local currency per unit of electricity, for example cents-per-kilowatt-hour for small numbers, or dollars-per-megawatt-hour for larger quantities	0
732	The calculation does not include wider system costs associated with each type of plant, such as long distance connections to grids, balancing and reserve costs, and does not include externalities such as health damage by coal plants, decommissioning costs of nuclear plant	0
733	These type of items can be explicitly added if necessary	0
734	It has little relation to actual price of power, and is widely used to assist policy makers and others to guide discussions and decision making	0
735	While calculating costs, several internal cost factors have to be considered	0
736	(Note the use of "costs," which is not the actual selling price, since this can be affected by a variety of factors such as subsidies and taxes): .   Capital costs (including waste disposal and decommissioning costs for nuclear energy) - tend to be low for fossil fuel power stations; high for wind turbines, solar PV and nuclear; very high for waste to energy, wave and tidal, solar thermal	0
737	Fuel costs - high for fossil fuel and biomass sources, very low for nuclear and renewables	0
738	Factors such as the costs of waste (and associated issues) and different insurance costs are not included in the following: Works power, own use or parasitic load - i.e	0
739	the portion of generated power actually used to run the stations pumps and fans has to be allowed for	0
740	To evaluate the total cost of production of electricity, the streams of costs are converted to a net present value using the time value of money	0
741	These costs are all brought together using discounted cash flow here	0
742	and here	0
743	Operational costs of wind power are rarely covered on the net	0
744	On the 10th of June 2011, DECC published a report, 'Review of the generation costs and deployment potential of renewable electricity technologies in the UK, available at	0
745	This study into the projected costs of renewable development, up to 2030, provides baseline data to inform support levels for a range of technologies over the coming years	0
746	In section 3.8.3 of DECC's report, wind operating costs are identified	0
747	Large-scale onshore wind projects median (central) operational costs are cited at £57,000/MW/year which for an annual average load factor of 0.23 (the British onshore wind fleet load factor in 2011 according to DUKES, the average with offshore being 25%), works out at £28.29p/MWh	0
748	These operational costs do not include capital cost recovery or interest on debt - they are operational costs	0
749	Table 9 of the report shows the projected future path of these operating costs	0
750	They are shown increasing slightly to £60,000/MW/year by 2030 (a very slow rate of increase)	0
751	The preceding text explains that that slow rate of increase is due to slight parts and labour increases	0
752	There is some other text explaining that operating costs seem to increase quite fast after a wind farm is five years old (because the model becomes dated and you are single-sourcing major component replacements)	0
753	For offshore wind farms of >100 MW (Round 3), table 17 indicates £168,700 per MW per year operational costs for offshore wind	0
754	Assuming an excellent 50% load factor for Round 3 offshore wind, that would amount to just £38.51/MWh operational costs for offshore (median round 3 figure 2010 basis, in table 17 in DECC's report)	0
755	These operational costs do not include capital cost recovery or interest on debt - they are operational costs	0
756	Another collection of cost calculations is shown here:, here, and, and	0
757	Another collection of cost calculations was made in December 2011 by the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, which commissioned a former Director of Operations of the British National Grid, Colin Gibson, to produce a report on generation levelised costs	0
758	This was published in December 2011 and is available on the internet :. The institution seeks to encourage debate of the issue, and has taken the unusual step among compilers of such studies of publishing a spreadsheet showing its data available on the internet : .  Levelised energy cost (LEC, also commonly abbreviated as LCOE) is the price at which electricity must be generated from a specific source to break even	0
759	It is an economic assessment of the cost of the energy-generating system including all the costs over its lifetime: initial investment, operations and maintenance, cost of fuel, cost of capital, and is very useful in calculating the costs of generation from different sources	0
760	It can be defined in a single formula as: .   \mathrm{LEC} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{ I_t + M_t + F_t}{\left({1+r}\right)^t} }{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{E_t}{\left({1+r}\right)^{t}} }  .   where   \mathrm{LEC} = Average lifetime levelised electricity generation cost  I_t = Investment expenditures in the year t  M_t = Operations and maintenance expenditures in the year t  F_t = Fuel expenditures in the year t  E_t = Electricity generation in the year t  r = Discount rate n = Life of the system .   Typically LECs are calculated over 20 to 40 year lifetimes, and are given in the units of currency per kilowatt-hour, for example AUD/kWh or EUR/kWh or per megawatt-hour, for example AUD/MWh (as tabulated below)	0
761	However, care should be taken in comparing different LCOE studies and the sources of the information as the LCOE for a given energy source is highly dependent on the assumptions, financing terms and technological deployment analyzed	0
762	Thus, a key requirement for the analysis is a clear statement of the applicability of the analysis based on justified assumptions	0
763	See a recent review on the subject stating reporting requirements and clearing up misconceptions about inputs : A Review of Solar Photovoltaic Levelized Cost of Electricity, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15, pp.4470-4482 (2011) http://www.appropedia.org/Review_of_Solar_Levelized_Cost .  When comparing LECs for alternative systems, it is very important to define the boundaries of the 'system' and the costs that are included in it	0
764	For example, should transmissions lines and distribution systems be included in the cost? Typically only the costs of connecting the generating source into the transmission system is included as a cost of the generator	0
765	But in some cases wholesale upgrade of the Grid is needed	0
766	Careful thought has to be given to whether or not these costs should be included in the cost of power	0
767	Should R&D, tax, and environmental impact studies be included? Should the costs of impacts on public health and environmental damage be included? Should the costs of government subsidies be included in the calculated LEC? .  Another key issue is the decision about the value of the discount rate r	0
768	The value that is chosen for r can often 'weigh' the decision towards one option or another, so the basis for choosing the discount must clearly be carefully evaluated	0
769	See internal rate of return	0
770	The discount rate depends on the cost of capital, including the balance between debt-financing and equity-financing, and an assessment of the financial risk	0
771	The tables below list the estimated cost of electricity by source for plants entering service in 2016	0
772	The tables are from a December 16, 2010 report of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) called "Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011"	0
773	Total System Levelized Cost (the rightmost column) gives the dollar cost per megawatt-hour that must be charged over time in order to pay for the total cost	0
774	Divide by 1000 to get the cost per kilowatt-hour (move the decimal point 3 places to the left)	0
775	These calculations reflect an adjustment to account for the high level of carbon dioxide produced by coal plants	0
776	From the EIA report: .   "a 3-percentage point increase in the cost of capital is added when evaluating investments in greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive technologies like coal-fired power and coal-to-liquids (CTL) plants without carbon control and sequestration (CCS)	0
777	While the 3-percentage point adjustment is somewhat arbitrary, in levelized cost terms its impact is similar to that of a $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fee.. As a result, the levelized capital costs of coal-fired plants without CCS are higher than would otherwise be expected." .   No tax credits or incentives are incorporated in the tables	0
778	From the EIA report (emphasis added):   "Levelized cost represents the present value of the total cost of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle, converted to equal annual payments and expressed in terms of real dollars to remove the impact of inflation	0
779	Levelized cost reflects overnight capital cost, fuel cost, fixed and variable O&M cost, financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate for each plant type	0
780	The availability of various incentives including state or federal tax credits can also impact the calculation of levelized cost	0
781	The values shown in the tables below do not incorporate any such incentives." .   Incentives, tax credits, production mandates, etc	0
782	are discussed in the overall comprehensive EIA report: "Annual Energy Outlook 2011"	0

793	More recent UK estimates are the Mott MacDonald study released by DECC in June 2010   and the Arup study for DECC published in 2011	0
794	The International Agency for the Energy and EDF have estimated for 2011 the following costs	0
795	For the nuclear power they include the costs due to new safety investments to upgrade the French nuclear plant after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster; the cost for those investments is estimated at 4 €/MWh	0
796	Concerning the solar power the estimate at 293 €/MWh is for a large plant capable to produce in the range of 50-100 GWh/year located in a favorable location (such as in Southern Europe)	0
797	For a small household plant capable to produce typically around 3 MWh/year the cost is according to the location between 400 and 700 €/MWh	0
798	Currently solar power is by far the most expensive renewable source to produce electricity, although increasing efficiency and longer lifespan of photovoltaic pannels together with reduced production costs could make this source of energy more competitive	0

In 1997 the Trade Association for Wind Turbines (Wirtschaftsverband Windkraftwerke e.V. -WVW) ordered&nbsp; a study into the costs of electricity production in newly constructed conventional power plants from the Rheinisch-Westfälischen Institute for Economic Research -RWI)	0
805	The RWI predicted costs of electricity production per kWh for the basic load for the year 2010 as follows:  Fuel Cost per kilowatt hour in euro cents	0
806	|- Nuclear Power 10.7 €ct - 12.4 €ct  . |- Brown Coal (Lignite) 8.8 €ct - 9.7 €ct  . |- Black Coal (Bituminous) 10.4 €ct - 10.7 €ct  . |- Natural gas 11.8 €ct - 10.6 €ct	0
807	The part of a base load represents approx	0
808	64% of the electricity production in total	0
809	The costs of electricity production for the mid-load and peak load are considerably higher	0
810	There is a mean value for the costs of electricity production for all kinds of conventional electricity production and load profiles in 2010 which is 10.9 €ct to 11.4 €ct per kWh	0
811	The RWI calculated this on the assumption that the costs of energy production would depend on the price development of crude oil and that the price of crude oil would be approx	0
812	23 US$ per barrel in 2010	0
813	In fact the crude oil price is about 80 US$ in the beginning of 2010	0
814	This means that the effective costs of conventional electricity production still need to be higher than estimated by the RWI in the past	0
815	The WVW takes the legislative feed-in-tariff as basis for the costs of electricity production out of renewable energies because renewable power plants are economically feasible under the German law (German Renewable Energy Sources Act-EEG)	0
816	The following figures arise for the costs of electricity production in newly constructed power plants in 2010:  Energy source Costs of electricity production in euros per megawatt hour . |- Nuclear Energy 107.0 - 124.0  . |- Brown Coal 88.0 -   97.0  . |- Black Coal 104.0 - 107.0  . |- Domestic Gas 106.0 - 118.0  . |- Wind Energy Onshore 49.7 -   96.1  . |- Wind Energy Offshore 35.0 - 150.0  . |- Hydropower 34.7 - 126.7  . |- Biomass 77.1 - 115.5  . |- Solar Electricity 284.3 - 391.4 .  A 2010 study by the Japanese government, called the Energy White Paper, concluded the cost for kilowatt hour was ¥49 for solar, ¥10 to ¥14 for wind, and ¥5 or ¥6 for nuclear power	0
817	Masayoshi Son, an advocate for renewable energy, however, has pointed out that the government estimates for nuclear power did not include the costs for reprocessing the fuel or disaster insurance liability	0
818	Son estimated that if these costs were included, the cost of nuclear power was about the same as wind power	0
819	The raw costs developed from the above analysis are only part of the picture in planning and costing a large modern power grid	0
820	Other considerations are the temporal load profile, i.e	0
821	how load varies second to second, minute to minute, hour to hour, month to month	0
822	To meet the varying load, generally a mix of plant options is needed, and the overall cost of providing this load is then important	0
823	Wind power has poor capacity contribution, so during windless periods, some form of back up must be provided	1
824	All other forms of power generation also require back up, though to a lesser extent	0
825	To meet peak demand on a system, which only persist for a few hours per year, it is often worth using very cheap to build, but very expensive to operate plant - for example some large grids also use load shedding coupled with diesel generators at peak or extreme conditions - the very high kWh production cost being justified by not having to build other more expensive capacity and a reduction in the otherwise continuous and inefficient use of spinning reserve	0
826	In the case of wind energy, the additional costs in terms of increased back up and grid interconnection to allow for diversity of weather and load may be substantial	0
827	This is because wind stops blowing frequently even in large areas at once and for prolonged periods of time	0
828	Some wind advocates have argue that in the pan-European case back up costs are quite low, resulting in overall wind energy costs about the same as present day power	0
829	However, such claim are generally considered too optimistic, except possibly for some marginal increases that, in particular circumstances, may take advantage of the existing infrastructure	0
830	The cost in the UK of connecting new offshore wind in transmission terms, has been consistently put by Grid/DECC/Ofgem at £15billion by 2020	0
831	This £15b cost does not include the cost of any new connections to Europe - interconnectors, or a supergrid, as advocated by some	0
832	The £15b cost is the cost of connecting offshore wind farms by cables typically less than 12&nbsp;km in length, to the UK's nearest suitable onshore connection point	0
833	There are total forecast onshore transmission costs of connecting various new UK generators by 2020, as incurred from 2010, of £4.7 billion, by comparison	0
834	When a new plant is being added to a power system or grid, the effects are quite complex - for example, when wind energy is added to a grid, it has a marginal cost associated with production of about £20/MWh (most incurred as lumpy but running-related maintenance - gearbox and bearing failures, for instance, and the cost of associated downtime), and therefore will always offer cheaper power than fossil plant - this will tend to force the marginally most expensive plant off the system	0
835	A mid range fossil plant, if added, will only force off those plants that are marginally more expensive	0
836	Hence very complex modelling of whose systems is required to determine the likely costs in practice of a range of power generating plant options, or the effect of adding a given plant	0
837	With the development of markets, it is extremely difficult for would-be investors to estimate the likely impacts and cost benefit of an investment in a new plant, hence in free market electricity systems, there tends to be an incipient shortage of capacity, due to the difficulties of investors accurately estimating returns, and the need to second guess what competitors might do	0
838	The Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland commissioned a former Director of Operations of the British National Grid, Colin Gibson, to produce a report on generation levelised costs that for the first time would include some of the transmission costs as well as the generation costs	0
839	This was published in December 2011 and is available on the internet :. The institution seeks to encourage debate of the issue, and has taken the unusual step among compilers of such studies of publishing a spreadsheet showing its data available on the internet : .  Nuclear power plants built recently, or in the process of being built, have incurred many cost overruns	0
840	Those being built now are expected to incur further cost overruns due to design changes after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster	0
841	Nuclear power has in the past been granted indemnity from the burden of carrying full third party insurance liabilities in accordance with the Paris convention on nuclear third-party liability, the Brussels supplementary convention, and the Vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage	0
842	The limited insurance that is required does not cover the full cost of a major nuclear accident of the kind that occurred at Chernobyl or Fukushima	0
843	An April 2011 report by Versicherungsforen Leipzig, a Leipzig company that specializes in actuarial calculations states that full insurance of German power plants against nuclear disasters would increase the price of nuclear electricity by €0.14/kWh ($0.20/kWh) to €2.36/kWh ($3.40/kWh), if the full potential damage sum of 6 trillion Euro is to be be paid as insurance fee over a time span of 10 to 100 years.	0
844	There is a renewable energy debate about the constraints and opportunities associated with the use of renewable energy	0
845	Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent	0
846	However, the International Energy Agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks	0
847	There have been "not in my back yard" (NIMBY) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction	0
848	In the USA, the Massachusetts Cape Wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns	0
849	However, residents in other areas have been more positive and there are many examples of community wind farm developments	0
850	According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the Ardrossan Wind Farm in Scotland has enhanced the area	0
851	The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow	0
852	Climate change concerns, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization	0
853	New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors	0
854	The Fukushima I nuclear accidents in Japan have brought new attention to how national energy systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, with climate change is already bringing more weather and climate extremes	0
855	These threats to our old energy systems provide a rationale for investing in renewable energy	0
856	Shifting to renewable energy "can help us to meet the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby limiting future extreme weather and climate impacts, and ensuring reliable, timely, and cost-efficient delivery of energy"	0
857	Investing in renewable energy can have significant dividends for our energy security	0
858	There is no shortage of renewable energy and a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources can be used to reliably meet electricity demand: Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps	0
859	As Amory Lovins has said: The variability of sun, wind and so on, turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things	0
860	One is to diversify your renewables by technology, so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another	0
861	Second, you diversify by site so they're not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because they're in the same place	0
862	Third, you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind, sun and rain, and of course hydro operators do this right now	0
863	Fourth, you integrate all your resources&nbsp;— supply side and demand side.."  .   The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with despatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet our needs reliably	0
864	Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world:  In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids"	0
865	In Fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the International Energy Agency, has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more	0
866	Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of a integrated European grid system:  In 2010, four German states, totalling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs	0
867	Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year)	0
868	The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind	0
869	Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity	0
870	Minnkota Power Cooperative, the leading U.S. wind utility in 2009, supplied 38% of its retail sales from the wind	0
871	Mark A. Delucchi and Mark Z. Jacobson report that there are at least seven ways to design and operate variable renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand:   (A) interconnect geographically-dispersed naturally-variable energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, wave, tidal), which smoothes out electricity supply (and demand) significantly	0
872	(B) use complementary and non-variable energy sources (such as hydroelectric power) to fill temporary gaps between demand and wind or solar generation	0
873	(C) use "smart" demand-response management to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available	0
874	(D) store electric power, at the site of generation, (in batteries, hydrogen gas, compressed air, pumped hydroelectric power, and flywheels), for later use	0
875	(E) over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses	0
876	(F) store electric power in electric-vehicle batteries, known as "vehicle to grid" or V2G.  (G) forecast the weather (winds, sunlight, waves, tides and precipitation) to better plan for energy supply needs	0
877	Jacobson and Delucchi argue that wind, water and solar power can be scaled up in cost-effective ways to meet our energy demands, freeing us from dependence on both fossil fuels and nuclear power	0
878	In 2009 they published "A Plan to Power 100 Percent of the Planet With Renewables" in Scientific American	0
879	The article addressed a number of issues, such as the worldwide spatial footprint of wind turbines, the availability of scarce materials needed for manufacture of new systems, the ability to produce reliable energy on demand and the average cost per kilowatt hour	0
880	A more detailed and updated technical analysis has been published as a two-part article in the journal Energy Policy	0
881	Renewable power technologies reduce dependence on foreign sources of fuel and therefore increase energy security	0
882	They decentralise electricity supply so that an accidental or intentional outage affects a smaller amount of capacity than an outage at a larger power station	0
883	They improve the reliability of power generation by producing power close to the end-user, and minimise the need to produce, transport and store hazardous fuels	0
884	Unlike generators relying on uranium and recycled plutonium, renewable energy is naturally replenished and not subject to the volatility of global fuel markets	0
885	Both solar and wind have been criticized from an aesthetic point of view	0
886	However, methods and opportunities exist to deploy these renewable technologies efficiently and unobtrusively: fixed solar collectors can double as noise barriers along highways, and extensive roadway, parking lot, and roof-top area is currently available; amorphous photovoltaic cells can also be used to tint windows and produce energy	0
887	Advocates of renewable energy also argue that current infrastructure is less aesthetically pleasing than alternatives, but sited further from the view of most critics	0
888	The United Kingdom is one of the world leaders in the deployment of renewables, hence it is instructive to look at the statistics for this region, in terms of comparing actual performance with projections	0
889	The key economic concern over renewables is that of the cost of subsidies, passed on to consumers in the form of substantially increased energy bills	0
890	The UK government operates a feed-in tariff scheme whereby private operators of solar photovoltaic installations can claim payments of several times the actual value of surplus power fed-in to the National Grid	0
891	This feed-in tariff, effectively a subsidy, has resulted in a bonanza for solar installations and the proliferation of firms specializing in their fitting	0
892	The result has been an unacceptable level of subsidy costs, costs which have had to be directly passed-on to energy consumers	0
893	In December 2011 a reduction in this feed-in tariff from 43p per kWh to 21p per kWh was announced	0
894	Presently, solar panel installers are fighting this reduction in the courts	0
895	Wind power has been touted as being approximately on a par with non-renewable energy sources in terms of cost per kilowatt-hour, and proponents claim that it should be able to function as base generating capacity	0
896	Emerging statistics do not appear to support that view	0
897	Specifically, claims that:  Turbines should achieve at least 30% of their max rated output on average  'The wind always blows somewhere' so zero national output should be a rare event  have been shown to be optimistic, with average outputs being typically in the 20-30% range, and frequent intervals of low or near-zero output having affected the whole of the UK.   Critics have raised the issue that the unpredictable intervals of near-zero output render windpower unsuitable as a base generating capacity	1
898	This, they say, creates a situation where alternative fast-response generating capacity must always be on standby, negating any fossil-fuel savings or reduction in carbon dioxide output	0
899	In view of these findings, and of the heavy subsidy provided at public expense to UK windpower operators, as of February 2012 over a hundred MPs have written to the Prime Minister urging a reduction in this subsidy	0
900	Renewable power technologies have significant environmental benefits since their use tends to avoid air pollution and the dangers and risks of extracting coal or uranium	0
901	They generate electricity without releasing significant quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change	0
902	One environmental issue, particularly with biomass and biofuels, is the large amount of land required to harvest energy, which otherwise could be used for other purposes or left as undeveloped land	0
903	However, it should be pointed out that these fuels may reduce the need for harvesting non-renewable energy sources, such as vast strip-mined areas and slag mountains for coal, safety zones around nuclear plants, and hundreds of square miles being strip-mined for oil sands	0
904	These responses, however, do not account for the extremely high biodiversity and endemism of land used for ethanol crops, particularly sugar cane	0
905	In the U.S., crops grown for biofuels are the most land- and water-intensive of the renewable energy sources	0
906	In 2005, about 12% of the nation's corn crop (covering 11 million acres (45,000&nbsp;km²) of farmland) was used to produce four billion gallons of ethanol—which equates to about 2% of annual U.S. gasoline consumption	0
907	For biofuels to make a much larger contribution to the energy economy, the industry will have to accelerate the development of new feedstocks, agricultural practices, and technologies that are more land and water efficient	0
908	The efficiency of biofuels production has increased significantly and there are new methods to boost biofuel production, although using bioelectricity, by burning the biomass to produce electricity for an electric car, increases the distance that a car can go from a hectare (about 2.5 acres) of crops by 81%, from 30,000&nbsp;km to 54,000&nbsp;km per year	0
909	However, covering that same hectare with photovoltaics (in relatively sunless Germany or England) allows the electric car to go 3,250,000&nbsp;km/year, over 100 times as far as from biofuel	0
910	The major advantage of hydroelectric systems is the elimination of the cost of fuel	0
911	Other advantages include longer life than fuel-fired generation, low operating costs, and the provision of facilities for water sports	0
912	Operation of pumped-storage plants improves the daily load factor of the generation system	0
913	Overall, hydroelectric power can be far less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuels or nuclear energy, and areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry	0
914	However, there are several disadvantages of hydroelectricity systems	0
915	These include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide at construction and flooding of the reservoir, disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife, adverse impacts on the river environment, potential risks of sabotage and terrorism, and in rare cases catastrophic failure of the dam wall	0
916	Large hydroelectric power is considered to be a renewable energy by a large number of sources, however, many groups have lobbied for it to be excluded from renewable electricity standards, any initiative to promote the use of renewable energies, and sometimes the definition of renewable itself	0
917	Some organizations, including US federal agencies, will specifically refer to "non-hydro renewable energy"	0
918	Hydroelectric power is now more difficult to site in developed nations because most major sites within these nations are either already being exploited or may be unavailable for other reasons such as environmental considerations	0
919	In the last twenty years international organizations like International Rivers, Hydropower Reform Coalition, World Commission on Dams, UNEP, World Conservation Union (IUCN), and the World Bank considered changing politics on large dams, as awareness about dams and hydro-energy generation environmental disadvantages grew, especially among affected populations	0
920	Hydro-energy and large dams may not be considered "clean" nor "renewable" sources of electricity because of their serious social and environmental impacts	0
921	Mark Diesendorf, formerly Professor of Environmental Science at the University of Technology, Sydney and a principal research scientist with CSIRO has summarised some of the benefits of onshore wind farms as follows	0
922	Studies of birds and offshore wind farms in Europe have found that there are very few bird collisions	0
923	Several offshore wind sites in Europe have been in areas heavily used by seabirds	0
924	Improvements in wind turbine design, including a much slower rate of rotation of the blades and a smooth tower base instead of perchable lattice towers, have helped reduce bird mortality at wind farms around the world	0
925	However older smaller wind turbines may be hazardous to flying birds	0
926	Birds are severely impacted by fossil fuel energy; examples include birds dying from exposure to oil spills, habitat loss from acid rain and mountaintop removal coal mining, and mercury poisoning	0
927	Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms	0
928	In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects	0
929	Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks	0
930	Some people may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community	0
931	Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power	0
932	In Germany, for example, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of Germany's electricity	0
933	Wind power has gained very high social acceptance in Germany	0
934	In America, wind projects are reported to boost local tax bases, helping to pay for schools, roads and hospitals	0
935	Wind projects also revitalize the  economy of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners	1
936	The Intrepid Wind Farm, in Iowa, is an example of one wind farm where the environmental impact of the project has been minimized through consultation and co-operation: .   "Making sure the wind farm made as gentle an environmental impact as possible was an important consideration	0
937	Therefore, when MidAmerican first began planning the Intrepid site, they worked closely with a number of state and national environmental groups	0
938	Using input from such diverse groups as the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the Nature Conservancy, Iowa State University, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, and the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club, MidAmerican created a statewide map of areas in the proposed region that contained specific bird populations or habitats	0
939	Those areas were then avoided as site planning got underway in earnest	0
940	In order to minimize the wind farm's environmental impact even further, MidAmerican also worked in conjunction with the Army Corp of Engineers, to secure all necessary permits related to any potential risk to wetlands in the area	0
941	Regular inspections are also conducted to make certain that the wind farm is causing no adverse environmental impact to the region."  .   Other examples include:  29 January 1997: Baywind Energy Co-operative began operating a 2.5 megawatt five-turbine wind farm near Ulverston, Cumbria	0
942	It was the first co-operative to own wind turbines in the United Kingdom	0
943	It has raised two million pounds and has 1,300 members	0
944	A proportion of the profits are invested in local community environmental initiatives through the Baywind Energy Conservation Trust	0
945	29 June 2003: After the Cape Wind project was proposed several miles off the coast of Cape Cod, some people raised objections, including U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy who owned a summer home in the area	0
946	Although he objected he finally came around and supported the idea	0
947	But attitudes to the proposed wind farm have become more positive in recent years	0
948	A 2007 public opinion survey found that more than four out of five Massachusetts residents (84 percent) - including 58 percent of those who live on the Cape—explicitly supported the proposed Cape Wind offshore wind farm	0
949	On 16 October 2003 in Galway, Ireland, construction of the foundation of a wind farm caused almost half a square kilometre of bog to slide 2.5 kilometres down a hillside	0
950	The slide destroyed an unoccupied farmhouse and blocked two roads	0
951	Nearby residents expressed concern over these environmental impacts	0
952	On 12 January 2004, it was reported that the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit against wind farm owners for killing tens of thousands of birds at the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area near San Francisco, California	0
953	In February 2008, a state appeals court upheld an earlier ruling that rejected the lawsuit	0
954	21 January 2005: Three wind turbines on the island of Gigha in Scotland generate up to 675 kW of power	0
955	Revenue is produced by selling the electricity to the grid via an intermediary called Green Energy UK. Gigha residents control the whole project and profits are reinvested in the community	0
956	Local residents call the turbines "The Three Dancing Ladies"	0
957	On 7 December 2007, it was reported that some environmentalists opposed a plan to build a wind farm in western Maryland But other local environmentalists say that the environmental effects of wind farms "pale in comparison to coal-burning generators, which add to global warming and lead to acid rain" that is killing trees in the same area	0
958	On 4 February 2008, according to British Ministry of Defence turbines create a hole in radar coverage so that aircraft flying overhead are not detectable	0
959	In written evidence, Squadron Leader Chris Breedon said: "This obscuration occurs regardless of the height of the aircraft, of the radar and of the turbine." An 16 April 2008 article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that three different environmental organizations had raised objections to a proposed wind farm at Shaffer Mountain in northeastern Somerset County, Pennsylvania, because the wind farm would be a threat to the Indiana bat, which is listed as an endangered species	0
960	25 July 2008: The Australian Hepburn Wind Project is a proposed wind farm, which will be the first Australian community-owned wind farm	0
961	The initiative emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address climate change	0
962	12 August 2008: The Ardrossan Wind Farm in Scotland has been "overwhelmingly accepted by local people"	0
963	Instead of spoiling the landscape, they believe it has enhanced the area: "The turbines are impressive looking, bring a calming effect to the town and, contrary to the belief that they would be noisy, we have found them to be silent workhorses"	0
964	22 March 2009: Some rural communities in Alberta, Canada want wind power companies to be allowed to develop wind farms on leased Crown land	0
965	28 April 2009: After the McGuinty government opposed calls for a moratorium on the construction of new turbines in Ontario, several protests took place around the province, especially at Queen's Park in Toronto	0
966	Residents insist that more studies take place before continuing construction of the devices in their communities	0
967	In March 2010, the Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative (TREC), incorporated in 1998, began organizing a new co-operative called "The Lakewind Project." Its initial project, WindShare, completed in 2002 on the grounds of Exhibition Place in central downtown Toronto, was the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre, and the first community-owned wind power project in Ontario	0
968	Even though a source of renewable energy may last for billions of years, renewable energy infrastructure, like hydroelectric dams, will not last forever, and must be removed and replaced at some point	0
969	Events like the shifting of riverbeds, or changing weather patterns could potentially alter or even halt the function of hydroelectric dams, lowering the amount of time they are available to generate electricity	0
970	Hydropower dams is also affected by silting which may or may not be cost effective to remove	0
971	Some have claimed that geothermal being a renewable energy source depends on the rate of extraction being slow enough such that depletion does not occur	0
972	If depletion does occur, the temperature can regenerate if given a long period of non-use	0
973	The government of Iceland states: "It should be stressed that the geothermal resource is not strictly renewable in the same sense as the hydro resource." It estimates that Iceland's geothermal energy could provide 1700 MW for over 100 years, compared to the current production of 140 MW. Radioactive elements in the Earth's crust continuously decay, replenishing the heat	0
974	The International Energy Agency classifies geothermal power as renewable	0
975	All biomass needs to go through some of these steps: it needs to be grown, collected, dried, fermented and burned	0
976	All of these steps require resources and an infrastructure	0
977	Some studies contend that ethanol is "energy negative", meaning that it takes more energy to produce than is contained in the final product	0
978	However, a large number of recent studies, including a 2006 article in the journal Science offer the opinion that fuels like ethanol are energy positive	0
979	Furthermore, fossil fuels also require significant energy inputs which have seldom been accounted for in the past	0
980	Additionally, ethanol is not the only product created during production, and the energy content of the by-products must also be considered	0
981	Corn is typically 66% starch and the remaining 33% is not fermented	0
982	This unfermented component is called distillers grain, which is high in fats and proteins, and makes good animal feed	0
983	In Brazil, where sugar cane is used, the yield is higher, and conversion to ethanol is somewhat more energy efficient than corn	0
984	Recent developments with cellulosic ethanol production may improve yields even further	0
985	According to the International Energy Agency, new biofuels technologies being developed today, notably cellulosic ethanol, could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than previously thought	0
986	Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants	0
987	Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass	0
988	Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many  regions of the United States	0
989	The ethanol and biodiesel production industries also create jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities	0
990	According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in  2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion	0
991	It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels	0
992	The U.S. electric power industry now relies on large, central power stations, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower plants that together generate more than 95% of the nation's electricity	0
993	Over the next few decades uses of renewable energy could help to diversify the nation's bulk power supply	0
994	Already, appropriate renewable resources (which excludes large hydropower) produce 12% of northern California's electricity	0
995	Although most of today's electricity comes from large, central-station power plants, new technologies offer a range of options for generating electricity nearer to where it is needed, saving on the cost of transmitting and distributing power and improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the system	0
996	Improving energy efficiency represents the most immediate and often the most cost-effective way to reduce oil dependence, improve energy security, and reduce the health and environmental impact of the energy system	0
997	By reducing the total energy requirements of the economy, improved energy efficiency could make increased reliance on renewable energy sources more practical and affordable	0
998	Nuclear power continues to be considered as an alternative to fossil-fuel power sources (see Low carbon power generation), and in 1956, when the first peak oil paper was presented, nuclear energy was presented as the replacement for fossil fuels	0
999	However, the prospect of increased nuclear power deployment was seriously undermined in the United States as a result of the Three Mile Island accident, and in the rest of the world after the Chernobyl disaster	0
1000	This trend has been slowly reversing, and several new nuclear reactors are scheduled for construction, however, there is again increasing resistance in light of the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents	0
1001	Physicist Bernard Cohen proposed in 1983 that uranium dissolved in seawater, when used in fast neutron reactors, is effectively inexhaustible and constantly replenished by rivers, and could therefore be considered a renewable source of energy	0
1002	However, this idea is not universally accepted, and issues such as peak uranium and uranium depletion are ongoing debates	0
1003	An assessment of the full environmental, social and political impacts of both renewable electricity and nuclear power technologies by Benjamin K. Sovacool concluded that: .   ".. renewable electricity technologies present policy makers with a superior alternative for minimising the risk of fuel interruptions and shortages, helping improve the fragile transmission network and reducing environmental harm	0
1004	These smaller and more environmentally friendly generators cost less to construct, produce power in smaller increments and need not rely on continuous government subsidies	0
1005	They generate little to no waste, have less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced and do not contribute significantly to the risk of accidents	0
1006	In contrast, the costs for nuclear plant construction, fuel, reprocessing, storage, decommissioning and further research are significant	0
1007	Even modern nuclear reactors run the risk of accidents and failures, shortages of high quality uranium ore may be imminent and the thermoelectric fuel cycle of nuclear plants consumes and sometimes degrades vast quantities of water	0
1008	Greenhouse gas emissions associated with the nuclear lifecycle are notable and reactors and waste storage sites invariably damage and degrade the natural environment"	0
1009	Legislative and scientific definitions of renewable energy, used when determining energy projects eligible for subsidies or tax breaks, usually exclude nuclear power.	0
1010	.   Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electricity, windmills for mechanical power, windpumps for water pumping or drainage, or sails to propel ships	0

1015	Wind power market penetration is expected to reach 3.35 percent by 2013 and 8 percent by 2018	0
1016	Several countries have already achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration, such as 28% of stationary (grid) electricity production in Denmark (2011), 19% in Portugal (2011), 16% in Spain (2011), 14% in Ireland (2010) and 8% in Germany (2011)	0
1017	As of 2011, 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis	0
1018	A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network	0
1019	Offshore wind power can harness the better wind speeds that are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power's contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher	0
1020	Small onshore wind facilities are used to provide electricity to isolated locations and utility companies increasingly buy back surplus electricity produced by small domestic wind turbines	0
1021	Although a variable source of power, the intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when using wind power to supply up to 20% of total electricity demand, but as the proportion rises, increased costs, a need to use storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity, upgrade the grid, or a lowered ability to supplant conventional production may occur	0
1022	Power management techniques such as excess capacity, storage, dispatchable backing supply (usually natural gas), exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low, can mitigate these problems	0
1023	Wind power, as an alternative to fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and uses little land	1
1024	In operation, the overall cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations	0
1025	The construction of wind farms is not universally welcomed, but any effects on the environment from wind power are generally much less problematic than those of any other power source	1
1026	Large-scale implementation of wind energy production will however need to address concerns related to siting, aesthetic and environmental factors, and land availability	0
1027	In the US, the development of the "water-pumping windmill" was the major factor in allowing the farming and ranching of vast areas otherwise devoid of readily accessible water	0
1028	Windpumps contributed to the expansion of rail transport systems throughout the world, by pumping water from water wells for the steam locomotives	0
1029	The multi-bladed wind turbine atop a lattice tower made of wood or steel was, for many years, a fixture of the landscape throughout rural America	0
1030	When fitted with generators and battery banks, small wind machines provided electricity to isolated farms	0
1031	In July 1887, a Scottish academic, Professor James Blyth, undertook wind power experiments that culminated in a UK patent in 1891	0
1032	In the US, Charles F. Brush produced electricity using a wind powered machine, starting in the winter of 1887-1888, which powered his home and laboratory until about 1900	0
1033	In the 1890s, the Danish scientist and inventor Poul la Cour constructed wind turbines to generate electricity, which was then used to produce hydrogen	0
1034	These were the first of what was to become the modern form of wind turbine	0
1035	The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, Vestas, Nordtank, and Bonus	0
1036	These early turbines were small by today's standards, with capacities of 20-30&nbsp;kW each	0
1037	Since then, they have increased greatly in size, with the Enercon E-126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries	0
1038	Wind power is expected to grow worldwide in the twenty-first century	0
1039	The Earth is unevenly heated by the sun, such that the poles receive less energy from the sun than the equator; along with this, dry land heats up (and cools down) more quickly than the seas do	0
1040	The differential heating drives a global atmospheric convection system reaching from the Earth's surface to the stratosphere which acts as a virtual ceiling	0
1041	Most of the energy stored in these wind movements can be found at high altitudes where continuous wind speeds of over occur	0
1042	Eventually, the wind energy is converted through friction into diffuse heat throughout the Earth's surface and the atmosphere	0
1043	The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources	1
1044	Axel Kleidon of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, did a "top down" calculation on how much wind energy there is, starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere	0
1045	He concluded that somewhere between 18 TW and 68 TW could be extracted	0
1046	Cristina Archer and Mark Z. Jacobson presented a "bottom-up" estimate, which unlike Kleidon's are based on actual measurements of wind speeds, and found that there is 1700 TW of wind power at an altitude of 100 metres over land and sea	0
1047	Of this, "between 72 and 170 TW could be extracted in a practical and cost-competitive manner"	0
1048	The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there	0
1049	To assess the frequency of wind speeds at a particular location, a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed data	0
1050	Different locations will have different wind speed distributions	0
1051	The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly wind speeds at many locations	0
1052	The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model	0
1053	A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used for production of electric power	0
1054	A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes	0
1055	A wind farm may also be located offshore	0
1056	Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the US. As of November 2010, the Roscoe Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the world at 781.5 MW, followed by the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center (735.5 MW)	0

1059	] .   Worldwide there are now many thousands of wind turbines operating, with a total nameplate capacity of 194,400&nbsp;MW. World wind generation capacity more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006, doubling about every three years	0
1060	The United States pioneered wind farms and led the world in installed capacity in the 1980s and into the 1990s	0
1061	In 1997 German installed capacity surpassed the U.S. and led until once again overtaken by the U.S. in 2008	0

In 2010, more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America	0
1067	This was largely from new construction in China, which accounted for nearly half the new wind installations (16.5 GW)	0
1068	Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2007 recorded an increase of installed capacity of 20&nbsp;GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 94&nbsp;GW, up from 74&nbsp;GW in 2006	0
1069	Despite constraints facing supply chains for wind turbines, the annual market for wind continued to increase at an estimated rate of 37%, following 32% growth in 2006	0
1070	In terms of economic value, the wind energy sector has become one of the important players in the energy markets, with the total value of new generating equipment installed in 2007 reaching €25 billion, or US$36 billion	0
1071	Although the wind power industry was affected by the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, a BTM Consult five year forecast up to 2013 projects substantial growth	0
1072	Over the past five years the average growth in new installations has been 27.6 percent each year	0
1073	In the forecast to 2013 the expected average annual growth rate is 15.7 percent	0
1074	More than 200&nbsp;GW of new wind power capacity could come on line before the end of 2013	0
1075	Wind power market penetration is expected to reach 3.35 percent by 2013 and 8 percent by 2018	0
1076	Offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in bodies of water to generate electricity from wind	0
1077	Better wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power's contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher	0
1078	Siemens and Vestas are the leading turbine suppliers for offshore wind power	0
1079	DONG Energy, Vattenfall and E.ON are the leading offshore operators	0
1080	As of October 2010, 3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe	0
1081	According to BTM Consult, more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets	0
1082	Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the US.  In a wind farm, individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (often 34.5 kV), power collection system and communications network	0
1083	At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system	0
1084	The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs	0
1085	Induction generators, often used for wind power, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction	0
1086	Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults (see: Low voltage ride through)	0
1087	In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators	0
1088	Doubly fed machines generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection	0
1089	Transmission systems operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid	0
1090	This will include power factor, constancy of frequency and dynamic behavior of the wind farm turbines during a system fault	0
1091	Since wind speed is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year	0
1092	The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor	0
1093	Typical capacity factors are 20-40%, with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favourable sites	0
1094	For example, a 1&nbsp;MW turbine with a capacity factor of 35% will not produce 8,760&nbsp;MW·h in a year (1 × 24 × 365), but only 1 × 0.35 × 24 × 365&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,066&nbsp;MW·h, averaging to 0.35&nbsp;MW. Online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output	0
1095	Unlike fueled generating plants, the capacity factor is affected by several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site, but also the generator size- having a smaller generator would be cheaper and achieve higher capacity factor, but would make less electricity (and money) in high winds	0
1096	Conversely a bigger generator would cost more and generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed	0
1097	Thus an optimum capacity factor can be used, which is usually around 20-35%.   In a 2008 study released by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the capacity factor achieved by the wind turbine fleet is shown to be increasing as the technology improves	0
1098	The capacity factor achieved by new wind turbines in 2004 and 2005 reached 36%.  Wind energy "penetration" refers to the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total available generation capacity	0
1099	There is no generally accepted "maximum" level of wind penetration	0
1100	The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for storage or demand management, and other factors	0
1101	An interconnected electricity grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures; this reserve capacity can also serve to regulate for the varying power generation by wind plants	0
1102	Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty	0
1103	These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electricity when needed	0
1104	Beyond the 20 percent level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant	0
1105	Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large (20% or more) scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics	0
1106	A wind energy penetration amount can be specified for different durations of time	0
1107	On an annual basis, as of 2011 few grid systems have penetration levels above five percent: Denmark - 26%, Portugal - 17%, Spain - 15%, Ireland - 14%, and Germany - 9%. For the U.S. in 2011, the penetration level was estimated at 2.9%.  Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: from hour to hour, daily, and seasonally	0
1108	Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant	0
1109	Related to variability is the short-term (hourly or daily) predictability of wind plant output	0
1110	Like other electricity sources, wind energy must be "scheduled"	0
1111	Wind power forecasting methods are used, but predictability of wind plant output remains low for short-term operation	0
1112	Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system	0
1113	Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management, load shedding, or storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables	1
1114	At low levels of wind penetration, fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large generating units requires reserve capacity that can also regulate for variability of wind generation	0
1115	Wind power can be replaced by other power stations during low wind periods	0
1116	Transmission networks must already cope with outages of generation plant and daily changes in electrical demand	0
1117	Systems with large wind capacity components may need more spinning reserve (plants operating at less than full load)	0
1118	Pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed	0
1119	Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods	0
1120	The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage; the cost of storage may add 25% to the cost of any wind energy stored, but it is not envisaged that this would apply to a large proportion of wind energy generated	0
1121	For example, in the UK, the 2 GW Dinorwig pumped storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plant more efficiently	0
1122	Although pumped storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs	0
1123	In particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power	0
1124	In the US states of California and Texas, for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to air conditioning	0
1125	Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient; widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds	0
1126	Another option is to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC "Super grid"	0
1127	In the US it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least $60 billion	0
1128	In the UK, demand for electricity is higher in winter than in summer, and so are wind speeds	0
1129	Solar power tends to be complementary to wind	0
1130	On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier	0
1131	On seasonal timescales, solar energy typically peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter	0
1132	Thus the intermittencies of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat	0
1133	The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock, entirely from renewable sources	0
1134	A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand 54 days during the year 2002	0
1135	Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power	0
1136	Conversely, on particularly windy days, even with penetration levels of 16%, wind power generation can surpass all other electricity sources in a country	0
1137	In Spain, on 8 November 2009 wind power production reached the highest percentage of electricity production till then, with wind farms covering 53% of the total demand	0
1138	Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs to be taken into account, but it does not make the grid unmanageable; and the additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified	0
1139	A 2006 International Energy Agency forum presented costs for managing intermittency as a function of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown: Increase in system operation costs, Euros per MW·h, for 10% and 20% wind share .  Many commentators concentrate on whether or not wind has any "capacity credit" without defining what they mean by this and its relevance	0
1140	Wind does have a capacity credit, using a widely accepted and meaningful definition, equal to about 20% of its rated output (but this figure varies depending on actual circumstances)	0
1141	This means that reserve capacity on a system equal in MW to 20% of added wind could be retired when such wind is added without affecting system security or robustness	0
1142	But the precise value is irrelevant since the main value of wind (in the UK, worth 5 times the capacity credit value) is its fuel and CO2 savings	0
1143	According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced to be used as reliable, baseload electric power, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height	0
1144	Wind power has low ongoing costs, but a moderate capital cost	1
1145	The estimated average cost per unit incorporates the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be in excess of twenty years	0
1146	Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially	0
1147	A 2011 report from the American Wind Energy Association stated, "Wind's costs have dropped over the past two years, in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently.. about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electricity, and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year.. winning more mainstream acceptance from Wall Street's banks.. Equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles.. 5,600 MW of new installed capacity is under construction in the United States, more than double the number at this point in 2010	0
1148	Thirty-five percent of all new power generation built in the United States since 2005 has come from wind, more than new gas and coal plants combined, as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves." .   A British Wind Energy Association report gives an average generation cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005)	0
1149	Cost per unit of energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be comparable to the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50	0
1150	Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011	0
1151	Other sources in various studies have estimated wind to be more expensive than other sources	1
1152	A 2009 study on wind power in Spain by Gabriel Calzada Alvarez Universidad Rey Juan Carlos concluded that each installed MW of wind power led to the loss of 4.27 jobs, by raising energy costs and driving away electricity-intensive businesses	0
1153	The U.S. Department of Energy found the study to be seriously flawed, and the conclusion unsupported	0
1154	The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price by minimising the use of expensive 'peaker plants'	1
1155	The marginal cost of wind energy once a plant is constructed is usually less than 1 cent per kW·h	0
1156	In 2004, wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s, and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt turbines were mass-produced	0
1157	capital costs for wind turbines are substantially lower than 2008-2010 but are still above 2002 levels	0
1158	Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development	0
1159	Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities	0
1160	In the US, wind power receives a tax credit for each kW·h produced; at 1.9 cents per kW·h in 2006, the credit has a yearly inflationary adjustment	0
1161	Another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation	0
1162	Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for "green credits"	0
1163	Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs)	0
1164	These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electricity prices	0
1165	The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines	0
1166	Secondary market forces also provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power, even if there is a premium price for the electricity	0
1167	For example, socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure	0
1168	Companies use wind-generated power, and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong "green" efforts	0
1169	In the US the organization Green-e monitors business compliance with these renewable energy credits	0
1170	Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor	1
1171	Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources	0
1172	The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months	0
1173	While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas such as turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use	0
1174	Wind farms need to be located in windy areas for greater efficiency, which often leads them to be placed on the top of ridges and hills, where they are particularly visible	0
1175	This leads some to complain that they 'ruin the landscape'	1
1176	While aesthetic issues are subjective and others find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity, groups of people often organize to attempt to politically block new wind power sites	0
1177	There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures	0
1178	The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances	0
1179	Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines	0
1180	A study on wind farm noise reported that people are annoyed by sound from wind turbines at far less sound levels than they are by noises from railroads, aircraft, or road traffic	0
1181	The study found the percentage of respondents who found noise levels highly annoying rose quickly as sound levels increased above about 37dbA (about the level of a conversation)	0
1182	In Denmark, a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine	0
1183	The loss must be at least 1% of the property's value	0
1184	A House of Lords Select Committee report (2008) on renewable energy in the UK reported a "concern over the prospective role of wind generated and other intermittent sources of electricity in the UK, in the absence of a break-through in electricity storage technology or the integration of the UK grid with that of continental Europe"	0
1185	Commenting on the EU's 2020 renewable energy target, Helm is critical of how the costs of wind power are cited by lobbyists	0
1186	Helm also says that wind's problem of intermittent supply will probably lead to another dash-for-gas or dash-for-coal in Europe, possibly with a negative impact on energy security	0
1187	In the US, the wind power industry has recently increased its lobbying efforts considerably, spending about $5 million in 2009 after years of relative obscurity in Washington	0
1188	By comparison, the US nuclear industry alone spent over $650 million on its lobbying efforts and campaign contributions during a single ten year period ending in 2008	0
1189	Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms	0
1190	In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects	0
1191	Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks	0
1192	Some people may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community	0
1193	Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power	0
1194	In Germany, for example, hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of Germany's electricity	0
1195	Wind power has gained very high social acceptance in Germany	0
1196	In America, wind projects are reported to boost local tax bases, helping to pay for schools, roads and hospitals	0
1197	Wind projects also revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners	1
1198	The Intrepid Wind Farm, in Iowa, is an example of one wind farm where the environmental impact of the project has been minimized through consultation and co-operation	0
1199	In the UK, the National Trust has expressed opposition to plans for a wind farm near Lyveden New Bield, a 17th Century lodge in Northamptonshire, believing it would upset the appeal of one of the finest Elizabethan gardens still in existence	0
1200	Some wind farms have become tourist attractions	0
1201	The Whitelee Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room, a learning hub, a café with a viewing deck and also a shop	0
1202	It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre	0
1203	Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50&nbsp;kW of electrical power	0
1204	Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators may use wind turbines to displace diesel fuel consumption	0
1205	Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electricity for economic or other reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint	0
1206	Wind turbines have been used for household electricity generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas	0
1207	Grid-connected wind turbines may use grid energy storage, displacing purchased energy with local production when available	0
1208	Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine	0
1209	Equipment such as parking meters or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a wind turbine that charges a small battery, replacing the need for a connection to the power grid	0
1210	In locations near or around a group of high-rise buildings, wind shear generates areas of intense turbulence, especially at street-level	0
1211	The risks associated with mechanical or catastrophic failure have thus plagued urban wind development in densely populated areas, rendering the costs of insuring urban wind systems prohibitive	0
1212	Moreover, quantifying the amount of wind in urban areas has been difficult, as little is known about the actual wind resources of towns and cities	0
1213	A new Carbon Trust study into the potential of small-scale wind energy has found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of electricity (0.4% of total UK electricity consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings	0
1214	This is based on the assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electricity, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h	0
1215	Distributed generation from renewable resources is increasing as a consequence of the increased awareness of climate change	0
1216	The electronic interfaces required to connect renewable generation units with the utility system can include additional functions, such as the active filtering to enhance the power quality.	0
1217	Modern United States Wind Energy Policy coincided with the beginning of modern wind industry of the United States, which began in the early 1980s with the arrival of utility-scale wind turbines in California (see Altamont Pass)	0
1218	Since then, the industry has had to endure the financial uncertainties caused by a highly fluctuating tax incentive program	0
1219	Because these early wind projects were fueled by investment tax credits based on installation rather than performance, they were plagued with issues of low productivity and equipment reliability	0
1220	Those investment tax credits expired in 1986, which forced investors to focus on improving the reliability and efficiency of their turbines	0
1221	The 1990s saw rise to a new type of tax credit, the production tax credit, which propelled technological improvements to the wind turbine even further by encouraging investors to focus on electricity output rather than installation	0
1222	Wind energy policy is generally directed at three categories of constituents:  Research and Development Organizations  Commercial/Residential Generators  Manufacturers and Producers .   with one of two goals:  incentivize or require production and installation of wind turbines or production of electricity from wind, or  facilitate the appropriate location of wind turbines	0
1223	Historically, incentives have come in the form of production or installation tax credits, grants, and renewable portfolio standards, at the federal, state, and local levels of government	0
1224	Policy facilitating appropriate location has historically come in the form of local ordinances and permitting requirements	0
1225	At the end of 2010, the installed capacity of wind power in the United States was just over 40,000 megawatts (MW), making it second in the world behind China	0
1226	In 2010 Wind power accounted for 2.3% of the electricity generated in the United States	0
1227	This amounted to 94,650 thousand megawatt-hours of electricity	0
1228	Driven by state renewable energy targets, fourteen states have installed over 1,000&nbsp;MW of wind capacity, and a total of 37&nbsp;states now have installed at least some utility-scale wind power	0
1229	Texas, with 9,728&nbsp;MW of capacity, has the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. state, followed by Iowa with 3,670&nbsp;MW. The Roscoe Wind Farm (780&nbsp;MW) in Texas is the world's largest wind farm	0
1230	Wind power is a clean, domestic, renewable resource that assists the U.S. in meeting energy, environmental, and economic challenges	0
1231	The U.S. wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity	0
1232	Wind projects boost local tax bases, and revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land	0
1233	GE Energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer	0
1234	There are currently 5,600 MW of projects under construction in 2011	0
1235	The U.S. Department of Energy's report 20% Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20% of all U.S. electricity, which included a contribution of 4% from offshore wind power	0
1236	Renewable energy policy gained interest after the oil shocks in the 1970s and environmental concerns because it offered diversification in the US energy portfolio Energy Policy and Conservation Act (P.L.  94-163)	0
1237	Wind energy was among the renewable energy options incorporated in energy policy beginning in the 1970s and continuing into the present day	0
1238	The growth in wind energy can largely be accredited to the public policy's providing incentives and technological advances, making wind energy one of the few cost competitive renewable energy options	0
1239	Although there has been a significant decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of wind energy since the 1980s, wind energy only accounts for a small portion of the U.S.'s electrical demand	0
1240	Wind energy policy has had two approaches to advance the industry	0
1241	One approach has been to increase implementation or improve the technology	0
1242	Alternatively, there has also been policy aimed to advance the entire industry as a whole, combining the implementation and technology	0
1243	The legislative history outlines the public policy that has taken place starting the 1970s leading up to current energy legislation and what effects it has made on renewable energy, specifically wind	0
1244	Signed into law in 1975 by President Ford, this act was designed to cut the energy demand	0
1245	Although this act primarily enacted because of oil shocks in the 1970s, it also encouraged programs, research and projects which dealt with alternative fuels	0
1246	The Secretary of Energy was instructed to report feasibility and progress on this matter to Congress	0
1247	The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA P.L. 95-617) passed in 1978 was very important to increasing electricity production from renewable energy facilities	0
1248	PURPA required that electric utilities must interconnect with renewable power production facilities	0
1249	They then would have to buy that power at a price mandated by their state equal to avoided cost; avoided cost is the cost a utility escapes by purchasing this power, opposed to building a new plant, consisting of capital and operating costs of the forgone plant	0
1250	The purpose of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Competitiveness Act 1989 (P.L. 101-218) was to set specific goals for the U.S. on the matter of wind, photovoltaics, and solar thermal energy programs	0
1251	For wind energy, the specific goals set include, "improving design methodologies and developing more reliable and efficient wind turbines to increase the cost competitiveness of wind energy	0
1252	Research efforts shall emphasize: (i) activities that address near-term technical problems and assist private sector exploitation of market opportunities of the wind energy industry; (ii) developing technologies such as advanced airfoils and variable speed generators to increase wind turbine output and reduce maintenance costs by decreasing structural stress and fatigue;(iii) increasing the basic knowledge of aerodynamics,structural dynamics, fatigue, and electrical systems interactions as applied to wind energy technology; and (iv) improving the compatibility of electricity produced from wind farms with conventional utility needs." .   The legislation continues by specifying goals for the Wind Energy Research Program, "(i) reduce average wind energy costs to 3 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour by 1995;(ii) reduce capital costs of new wind energy systems to $500 to $750 per kilowatt of installed capacity by 1995; (iii) reduce operation and maintenance costs for wind energy systems to less than one cent per kilowatt hour by 1995; and(iv) increase capacity factors for new wind energy systems to 25 to 35 percent by 1995." .  This act is an amendment to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978 and the Federal Power Act	0
1253	The main purpose is the remove the size limitations placed on renewable energy facilities, such as solar and wind, to receive PURPA benefits	0
1254	This will encourage the development of renewable energy production	0
1255	The act specifies the qualification, application, and construction deadlines and requirements for the facilities	0
1256	The act was amended in 1991, because of a technicality, to include renewable energy facilities of all sizes	0
1257	The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486) replaced the National Energy Conservation Act (NECPA) and focused on the following issues: water conservation, Federal energy efficiency fund, utility incentive programs, financial incentive program, demonstration of new technology, general services administration Federal building fund, energy savings performance contracts, energy audit teams, energy-efficient product procurement; U.S. Postal Service and Congressional building regulations, and fleet management	0
1258	Title XII of this Act directly discusses renewable energy and amends the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989 by, "(1) implement a five-year program to further the commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies by soliciting proposals for demonstration and commercial application projects; and (2) establish an Advisory Committee on Demonstration and Commercial Application of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technologies." .   It further instructs the Secretary to, "(1) prepare and submit to the Congress a three-year national renewable energy and energy efficiency management plan with specified contents; (2) establish a renewable energy export technology training program for individuals from developing countries; (3) make Renewable Energy Advancement Awards in recognition of developments that advance the practical application of certain renewable energy technologies; and (4) study and report to the Congress on whether certain conventional taxation and ratemaking procedures result in economic barriers to, or incentives for, renewable energy power plants compared to conventional power plants." .  EPACT '92 enacted the renewable electricity production tax credit (PTC)	0
1259	The PTC is a corporate tax credit for several renewable sources including wind, which credited 1.5₡ per kWh for electricity produced by wind power	0
1260	The PTC expired in July 1999 and has been expanded and extended several times through many different laws including the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-47), American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357), Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) and several others . Most recently, the PTC was extended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5)	0
1261	It will expire at the end of 2012 and now credits 2.2₡ per kWh for electricity produced by wind power	0
1262	The PTC has been a major incentive for wind power, and has helped to spur independent wind energy power producers	0
1263	EPACT '92 also established a federal performance based incentive for renewable energy, which includes wind energy	0
1264	The Renewable Energy Production Incentive's (REPI) purpose is to give incentive payments for electricity generated and sold by new qualifying renewable energy sources	0
1265	Eligible facilities could receive 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), in 1993 dollars, now adjusted for inflation to equal 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, for the first 10 years of operation	0
1266	This incentives is to be in addition to the federal renewable energy production tax credit (PTC)	0
1267	This incentive's deadline is October 1, 2016 and applies only to electricity sold to another entity	0
1268	EPACT 2005 (P.L. 109-58) addresses numerous energy management goals for Federal facilities	0
1269	The act also makes amendments to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA)	0
1270	Several issues it addresses include: metering and reporting, energy-efficient product procurement, energy savings performance contracts, building performance standards, renewable energy requirements, and alternative fuel use	0
1271	The effect on wind energy is through the renewable energy requirements	0
1272	Renewable energy requirement .   The Secretary of Energy shall, when technically and economically feasible, require the total electric energy consumed to be provided by renewable energy for the Federal government: .   1	0
1273	Not less than 3% from 2007-2009 .   2	0
1274	Not less than 5% from 2010-2012 .   3	0
1275	Not less than 7.5% from 2013 and beyond .   Double credit must be given if the renewable energy is produced at a Federal facility, on Federal lands or Native American Lands	0
1276	A PV commercialization program must be established for Federal buildings and 20,000 solar energy systems must be installed in Federal buildings	0
1277	In order to meet these requirements, government agencies must submit an annual report to the Department of Energy	0
1278	This must detail their progress towards meeting the standards as a part of their annual data reporting	0
1279	The Secretary of Energy then must provide a report to Congress, using the agencies information	0
1280	.  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (PL 110-140) had very few policy provisions with regards to the wind industry	0
1281	The only major stipulation regarding wind is in section 656 of the act	0
1282	It directs the DOE to set up a cost-shared Renewable Energy Innovation Manufacturing Partnership Program	0
1283	This program would make awards to support research, development and demonstration of advanced manufacturing processes, materials and infrastructure for renewable energy technologies	0
1284	Wind systems are one of the several alternative forms of energy equipment that are eligible for these rewards	0
1285	This section sets further goals to increase domestic renewable energy production as well as to better coordinate federal state and private sector resources	0
1286	Most recently, wind energy policy has continued through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5), signed into law by President Obama	0
1287	In terms of wind energy, five areas were advanced: 1	0
1288	an extension was given for the federal production tax credit (PTC) until December 31, 2012; 2	0
1289	wind energy facilities can make use of an investment tax credit (ITC) for certain property in substitution for PTC; 3	0
1290	wind projects initiated in 2009 and 2010 can receive a 30% grant from the Treasury Department for the cost of the property; 4	0
1291	general business credits were modified; 5	0
1292	the 2009 bonus depreciation was extended	0
1293	Qualifying for an ITC gives a credit of 30% on the cost of the property used for a wind facility	0
1294	Cash grants, eliminate the need for a partner to utilize tax credits	0
1295	The carryback period was extended for the business credit, along with the bonus depreciation	0
1296	Additional related incentives include 30% investment credits for manufacturers of renewable energy technologies, an increase in new clean renewable energy bonds to finance wind facilities, and funding towards advancing the electrical grid	0
1297	Along with these advancements in policy, $1.64 billion was allocated for renewable energy, with $93 million for wind energy projects	0
1298	$45 million will go towards wind turbine drivetrain R&D and testing, $14 million for technology development, $24 million for wind power research and development, and $10 million for the National Wind Technology Center	0
1299	Along with this funding the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will receive more than $100 million from ARRA.  Production Tax Credits (PTC) were a part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992(102nd Congress H.R.776.ENR, abbreviated as EPACT92)and are intended for wind and bioenergy resources	0
1300	The purpose of the Production Tax Credit is to support renewable energy based upon the environmental, economic, and energy security benefits that renewable energy resources can provide	0
1301	Besides wind energy, the PTC also covers closed loop biomass, geothermal power, and half the rate for open loop biomass, hydropower, landfill gas, and municipal solid waste	0
1302	The PTC provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour benefit for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility's operation	0
1303	It is only available for wind energy equipment located within the United States and only if electricity produced is sold to an unrelated party	0
1304	Any unused credits may be carried forward for up to 20 years following generation	0
1305	History of the Production Tax Credit .   The Energy Policy Act of 1992 originally enacted the Production Tax Credit and the first lapse came in June 1999	0
1306	The PTC was extended in December 1999 until December 31, 2001	0
1307	Once again the PTC expired in December 2001 and was not enacted again until March 2002 where it was then extended for another two years	0
1308	At the end of 2003 the PTC expired for a third time until a one year extension was granted in October 2004	0
1309	With the 2004 extension, former President George Bush included the Production Tax Credit within a group of tax incentives for businesses	0
1310	The PTC was extended through 2005 and also expanded the different types of renewable energies that would be included under the bill	0
1311	The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (H.R. 6) modified the credit and extended it through the end of 2007	0
1312	In December 2006, the PTC was extended for another year by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (H.R. 6111)	0
1313	President Barack Obama extended the PTC by signing into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R. 1)	0
1314	The Wind PTC was extended an additional two years, expiring the end of 2012	0
1315	The EIA reported that wind generation would be more than doubled by 2012 due to the extended tax credit options	0
1316	Impacts of Production Tax Credit .   The Production Tax Credit has been the primary incentive for wind energy and has been essential to the industry's research and development	0
1317	Wind Power development in the United States has shown a great dependence on the PTC. The wind industry has experienced growth during the years leading up to the expiration of the PTC and a dramatic decrease in installed wind capacity in years where the PTC has lapsed	0
1318	In 2003, 1687 MW of capacity were installed leading up to a lapse of the PTC in 2004	0
1319	In 2004, only 400 MW of capacity were installed in the United States	0
1320	With the PTC reinstated in 2005, 2431 MW of capacity were installed which was a record at the time for the United States	0
1321	The PTC allowed for the United States to lead the world in wind power additions in 2005 and 2006 with 16% of the worldwide capacity being installed in 2006 coming from the United States	0
1322	The planning and permitting process for wind energy can take up to two years	0
1323	With short-term extensions of the PTC, big investments from companies for research and development are less likely to occur	0
1324	The current trend of short-term extensions of the Production Tax Credit have led to a boom and bust cycle of short-term planning and low number of investments	0
1325	As the PTC expires many investors hurry to finish projects thus producing smaller capacity installations and creating higher electricity costs	0
1326	Longer term Production Tax Credit policy would stimulate low-cost wind development and establish a more stable policy for wind development	0
1327	Having short-term extensions on the PTC can potentially slow wind development, raise costs, require a greater reliance on foreign manufacturing, produce transmission issues, and most importantly can reduce the amount of research and development of wind energy	0
1328	The world energy council has estimated that new wind capacity worldwide will amount to $150 to $ 400 billion in new business over the next twenty years	0
1329	Incentives of PTC .   There are several incentives that go along with a Wind Production Tax Credit.The PTC provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour benefit for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility's operation	0
1330	A second incentive of PTC is wind developers can receive a 30% Investment Tax Credit(ITC) in place of the Production Tax Credit	0
1331	This only applies if the projects are placed in service between 2009 and 2013	0
1332	Lastly, a third incentive of the Production Tax Credit is providing grants that cover up to 30% of the renewable energy projects	0
1333	This program is under the Department of Treasury and is effective for wind projects that are placed in service in 2009-2010 or the construction is begun by 2010 and plans to be in service before 2013	0
1334	According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, released in a report titled "PTC, ITC, or Cash Grant? An Analysis of the Choice Facing Renewable Power Projects in the United States" in March 2009, projects that cost $1,500/kW or less are likely to receive more value from the PTC, while  projects that cost more than $2,500/kW are likely to be better off with the ITC.  Wind energy policy mostly comes from a state level due to the limited access to relevant federal incentives	0
1335	Most states in the US have energy policies to help support wind energy development	0
1336	State policies offer incentives and tax credits for both producers and consumers to make wind energy more affordable	0
1337	These tax credits are towards personal finances or property value	0
1338	Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and state grant programs are also used to increase wind energy usage in the United States	0
1339	By using these incentives, the US can make wind power more prominent to push for renewable energy sources, in an effort to lessen its dependence on foreign oil, protect the environment, and stabilize its energy costs	0
1340	This section outlines different financial incentives available by state, and programs designed to increase the development and use of wind power	0
1341	It also displays state permitting and ordinance requirements, usually done on a county level, that are important to know before installing wind turbines	0
1342	Tax credits for renewable energy technology support the adoption of clean energy technologies by reducing net project costs to consumers, and encouraging market acceptance of clean energy practices	0
1343	They offer personal financial incentives and property value financial incentives for investing in renewable energy technologies like wind power	0
1344	They can be used to exempt wind energy equipment from sales taxes to reduce capital investment	0
1345	They can also be used to reduce property taxes for wind power facilities, or to reduce federal income taxes for qualified tax-paying owners based on the capital investments incurred in wind project development	0
1346	At the state level, the terms of credit, the amount of credit, and the cost of the credit differs between states	0
1347	Using state incentives and tax credits helps meet state clean energy policy objectives	0
1348	According to the Department of Energy, tax credits are generally more valuable than an equivalent tax deduction	0
1349	They reduce dollar-by-dollar as opposed to removing a percentage of a tax that is owed	0
1350	They target and benefit: manufacturers, purchasers, building operators, and commercial, industrial, and residential customers	0
1351	Tax credits and incentives appear to be most effective when linked to other policies, which is important to consider when designing state tax incentive programs to most effectively leverage the tax credits in EPAct 2005	0

Renewable Portfolio Standards are written policy designed to require retail power suppliers to provide a certain minimum percentage of electricity, from a specific renewable power source, for a specified period of time	0
1355	RPS programs are often used because of the energy, environmental, and economic benefits created by using renewable energy	0
1356	RPS programs create market demand for renewable energy supplies by aiming to stimulating the energy market to make clean energy economically competitive with conventional forms of electric power	0
1357	According to The Environmental Protection Agency in "", current states with RPS requirements mandate that 4% - 30% of electricity be generated from renewable sources by a specified date, however, Renewable Portfolio Standards can have multiple goals	0
1358	Current RPS programs also include goals for local, regional, or global environmental benefits, local economic development, reducing the risks fossil fuel pricing, and advancing renewable energy technologies	0
1359	There are two types of Renewable Portfolio Standards: mandatory and voluntary	0
1360	As stated before, mandatory markets require the electricity service providers a minimum amount of renewable energy in their electricity supply while voluntary electricity markets allow the consumer to choose to surpass required policy and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use further than required	0
1361	Mandatory RPS programs are rarely applied to municipal utilities which are usually self regulated, but rather to investor-owned utilities and electric service providers	0
1362	Voluntary markets help create renewable energy capacity that exceeds what mandatory markets contribute nationwide	0
1363	According to the EPA, based on knowledge gained from states with successful Renewable Portfolio Standards, designing and implementing an effective RPS program relies heavily on: support of state government, facilitated discussions with important stakeholders focusing on an appropriate RPS design, clear goals and objectives, and designing a clear and easy-to-use accounting system for compliance	0
1364	It is also important to conduct a mid-term performance review	0
1365	This should be done to identify the causes for any delay in meeting the RPS targets, and to make program changes as needed to meet the original goals of the RPS. As of 2009 33 states including Washington DC had enacted successful Renewable Portfolio Standards, and currently there are 37	0
1366	In 2003 RPS programs produced more than 2,300 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity	0
1367	In February 2009, the Union of Concerned Scientists project stated that RPS will account for 76,750 megawatts (MW) of new renewable power by 2025	0

States offer a variety of grant programs to encourage the use and growth of renewable energy	0
1371	Wind energy project grants are offered primarily for the use in the commercial, industrial, utility, education, and government sectors	0
1372	Applying for grants offers consumers a way to ease the investments costs in wind development projects	0
1373	They can also be used to support research and development	0
1374	They are obtained by applying to the different state programs and are offered in the form of cash or tax credits	0
1375	Grant programs offer a way to pay for large portions of wind project initial costs and help support a national renewable energy system to be less dependent on traditional energy sources, and to protect the environment from future harm	0

Wind power investors frequently encounter non-financial dilemmas in the wind energy development process, due to zoning ordinances and permits	0
1379	Zoning was first implemented in the 1920s, and it is one form of a land-use law	0
1380	According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, "having zoning requirements is the principle means for local governments to implement land-use planning"	0
1381	The intent of establishing zoning laws is that land-use choices and regulation be done at a local level staying as close as possible to the property owners affected by the installation	0
1382	However, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency there are some states with permitting requirements and ordinances decided by state government	0
1383	Oftentimes established ordinances do not address technologies like wind turbines	0
1384	They also frequently have height restrictions, typically structures built taller than 35 feet require special use permits	0
1385	Wind turbines are rarely identified as an allowed use of property, therefore the development of a wind power system requires more than just a large investment	0
1386	Projects often need permits to monitor environmental impacts such as soil erosion and sedimentation, as well	0
1387	It is important to be aware of these requirements, and to look further into county policy when pursuing a wind project	0
1388	Below is a table of state policy for land use	0

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor	0
1391	Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources	0
1392	The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months	0
1393	While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use	0
1394	There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines, as there are around other artificial structures	0
1395	The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances	0
1396	Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines	0
1397	There are conflicting reports about the effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine	0
1398	The electric transmission grid in the United States is an aging infrastructure that poses limitations for new wind development that includes limited geographic access and capacity, scheduling difficulties, and delays in interconnecting	0
1399	Because much of the nation's most promising wind resources are located in remote regions of the country, locating access to existing transmission lines is often a challenge	0
1400	Investment in new transmission infrastructure is a costly and often economically unfeasible prospect	0
1401	The expense of constructing new transmission access is such a high barrier to market entry that private companies have begun investing in transmission infrastructure with the hope of lowering the cost of new wind projects (see Atlantic Wind Connection)	0
1402	Congestion in existing lines also presents a threat to new wind facilities	0
1403	Requests for transmission are often denied due to congestion	0
1404	In 2006, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation reported 2,397 transmission request denials	0
1405	The high frequency of transmission congestion also leads to long interconnection queues that are a required part of the development process	0
1406	The intermittent nature of wind power has conflicted with the original policies placed on power generators	0
1407	Under these policies, electricity generators would be charged economic penalties if they did not meet their promised quotas	0
1408	Because wind facilities do not have full control over the times and quantities of their electricity output, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order No	1
1409	890 to reform these generator imbalance charges	0
1410	The framework for offshore wind policy in the United States has been shaped since the late 1800s	0
1411	Though not directly associated, the first policy regulation was stated in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, where the United States Army Corps of Engineers had authority over any construction in federal waters	0
1412	It wasn't until 2005 that the authority changed, when the Energy Policy Act of 2005(Pub.L. 109-58) was enacted, and established the Secretary of the Interior to administer the federal water, within the federal regulatory agency of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), previously known as the Minerals Management Service (MMS)	0
1413	The agency is "responsible for overseeing the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf."	0
1414	Other policies that have affected offshore wind development in federal waters include the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337), and the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347)	0
1415	The only policy in state waters is the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-583)	0
1416	The first offshore wind project in the U.S. was proposed in 2001 by Cape Wind	0
1417	The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed the lead federal regulatory role under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, and issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in 2004	0
1418	In 2004, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) produced ".'' The report explored the potential and feasibility for installing wind turbines off the Mid Atlantic Coast, Gulf Coast, and in the Great Lakes	0
1419	The framework also discusses in great detail the major challenges that would lie ahead such as technology development, environmental compatibility, economic financial viability, regulation and government policies, and leadership coordination	0
1420	Following the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), assumed lead federal responsibility and initiated its own independent environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)	0
1421	While the DOE focused on onshore wind development, several coastal states launched significant initiatives to attract, incentivize, and plan for wind development offshore	0
1422	In 2009, the U.S. Offshore Wind Collaborative (USOWC) released the paper "." This document presents a snapshot of U.S. offshore wind energy and serves as a resource for government, industry, and non-governmental stakeholders.ref> .   On October 6, 2010 the United States Department of the Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Cape Wind Associates President Jim Gordon signed the nation's first lease for commercial wind energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)	0
1423	On February 7, 2011, Energy Secretary Chu announced	0
1424	The strategy comes with $50 million of funding to be dispersed to technology development, removing market barriers, and next generation drivetrain	0
1425	The new strategy will pursue offshore opportunities in both federal and state waters	0
1426	Offshore wind energy projects in state waters are subject to permitting based on the Coastal Zone Management Plans established in each state	0
1427	The majority of states operate under parallel agencies that provide policy regulation	0
1428	Wind projects that would stretch between coastal states would require permitting consistent within each states coastal plan	0
1429	Permitting discrepancies for such projects may arise causing lengthy delays in construction of offshore wind farms	0
1430	The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-583, 86 Stat	0
1431	1280, enacted October 27, 1972, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451-1464, Chapter 33) (see Coastal Zone Management Act) was enacted in an effort to encourage states to establish coastal zone management plans	0
1432	The plans would focus on preservation through protecting wildlife and natural resources	0
1433	Each state program must allocate preservation measures and permitted uses for land and water resources	0
1434	The Act was amended through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to investigate the most recent issues that face the coastal land and waters	0
1435	Congress listed several findings, including "a national objective of attaining a greater degree of energy self sufficieny through expanding energy activity in the coastal region." .  Offshore wind energy projects in federal waters are subject to permitting based on lease agreements given by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior with BOEMRE. The President announced on April 22, 2009 that the Interior Department completed the Final Renewable Energy Framework to govern management of the Renewable Energy Program	0
1436	"The final rule establishes a program to grant leases, easements, and rights-of-way for orderly, safe, and environmentally responsible renewable energy development activities, such as the sitting and construction of offshore wind farms on the OCS as well as other forms of renewable energy such as wave, current, and solar."	0
1437	The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 stated that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was the governing body for construction of any structure in federal waters	0
1438	Any obstruction not approved by Congress would be prohibited from being constructed in any of the waters of the United States	0
1439	The Chief of Engineers had to recommend any structures built and then gain approval from the Secretary of War	0
1440	Although the Corps jurisdiction over offshore wind projects was never explicitly stated in the Act, Section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 sought out to clear up any misconceptions	0
1441	Section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Pub.L. 109-58) amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ((43 U.S.C. 1337))	0
1442	The amendment states that the Secretary of the Interior may grant a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf not otherwise stated in the Act	0
1443	Offshore wind related projects could now be given leases at the disposal of the Sectretary of the Interior within the federal regulating agency of BOEMRE. Prior to any lease agreements, all alternate energy projects must meet the standards of the National Environmental Policy Act	0
1444	The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) was enacted as the framework for environmental policy making in the U.S., with a goal of protecting, restoring, and enhancing the environment	0
1445	The BOEMRE created documents for energy development planning to meet NEPA standards	0
1446	They prepare Environmental Assessments (EA) to determine if there are environmental consequences for a potential offshore project, and also Categorical Exclusion Reviews (CER) to verify if and EA or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary in the first place	0
1447	Cape Wind is the first offshore wind project in the U.S. to be granted a lease in federal waters after nearly 10 years of strenuous permitting	0
1448	The Cape Wind Associates first applied for a lease in 2001 to the US Army Corps of Engineers, who at the time were responsible for granting leases under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899	0
1449	Immediately following, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound was created to oppose the project	0
1450	In 2002 the Corps announced that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be required from the Cape Wind Associates	0
1451	The EIS was submitted in 2004 stating that the project would bring many benefits to the people of Cape Cod and had positive environmental impacts	0
1452	After the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Department of the Interior assumed main responsibility for granting a lease to the project and acknowledged the need for a new EIS. In 2009, the new EIS is released to the public, and in April 2010 the project is approved	0
1453	On October 6, 2010, Secretary of the Department of the Interior Ken Salazar signs the first offshore lease with the Cape Wind Associates.	0
1454	.   Energy development is the effort to provide sufficient primary energy sources and secondary energy forms for supply, cost, impact on air pollution and water pollution, mitigation of climate change with renewable energy	0
1455	Technologically advanced societies have become increasingly dependent on external energy sources for transportation, the production of many manufactured goods, and the delivery of energy services	0
1456	This energy allows people who can afford the cost to live under otherwise unfavorable climatic conditions through the use of heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning	0
1457	Level of use of external energy sources differs across societies, as do the climate, convenience, levels of traffic congestion, pollution and availability of domestic energy sources	0
1458	Renewable energy is energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat, which are renewable (naturally replenished.) Renewable energy is an alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear power, and was commonly called alternative energy in the 1970s and 1980s	0
1459	In 2008, about 19% of global final energy consumption came from renewables, with 13% coming from traditional biomass, which is mainly used for heating, and 3.2% from hydroelectricity	0

1464	Solar thermal power stations operate in the USA and Spain, and the largest of these is the 354 megawatt (MW) SEGS power plant in the Mojave Desert	0
1465	The world's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW. Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel	0
1466	Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the USA.   Climate change concerns, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization	0
1467	New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors	0
1468	Scientists have advanced a plan to power 100% of the world's energy with wind, hydroelectric, and solar power by the year 2030, recommending renewable energy subsidies and a price on carbon reflecting its cost for flood and related expenses	0

1483	As of November 2010, the Thanet Offshore Wind Project in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 300 MW, followed by Horns Rev II (209 MW) in Denmark	0
1484	In hydro energy, the gravitational descent of a river is compressed from a long run to a single location with a dam or a flume	0
1485	This creates a location where concentrated pressure and flow can be used to turn turbines or water wheels, which drive a mechanical mill or an electric generator	0
1486	In some cases with hydroelectric dams, there are unexpected results	0
1487	One study shows that a hydroelectric dam in the Amazon has 3.6 times larger greenhouse effect per kW•h than electricity production from oil, due to large scale emission of methane from decaying organic material, though this is most significant as river valleys are initially flooded, and are of much less consequence for more boreal dams	0
1488	This effect applies in particular to dams created by simply flooding a large area, without first clearing it of vegetation	0
1489	There are however investigations into underwater turbines that do not require a dam	0
1490	And pumped-storage hydroelectricity can use water reservoirs at different altitudes to store wind and solar power	0
1491	Solar power involves using solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity, using sunlight hitting solar thermal panels to convert sunlight to heat water or air, using sunlight hitting a parabolic mirror to heat water (producing steam), or using sunlight entering windows for passive solar heating of a building	0
1492	It would be advantageous to place solar panels in the regions of highest solar radiation	0
1493	At the end of 2009, cumulative global photovoltaic (PV) installations surpassed 21 GW and PV power stations are popular in Germany and Spain	0

1501	Biomass production involves using garbage or other renewable resources such as corn or other vegetation to generate electricity	0
1502	When garbage decomposes, the methane produced is captured in pipes and later burned to produce electricity	0
1503	Vegetation and wood can be burned directly to generate energy, like fossil fuels, or processed to form alcohols	0
1504	Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel	0
1505	Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the USA.   Vegetable oil is generated from sunlight, H2O, and CO2 by plants	0
1506	It is safer to use and store than gasoline or diesel as it has a higher flash point	0
1507	Straight vegetable oil works in diesel engines if it is heated first	0
1508	Vegetable oil can also be transesterified to make biodiesel, which burns like normal diesel	0
1509	Geothermal energy harnesses the heat energy present underneath the Earth	0
1510	Two wells are drilled	0
1511	One well injects water into the ground to provide water	0

1517	The world's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW.  Tidal power can be extracted from Moon-gravity-powered tides by locating a water turbine in a tidal current, or by building impoundment pond dams that admit-or-release water through a turbine	0
1518	The turbine can turn an electrical generator, or a gas compressor, that can then store energy until needed	0
1519	Coastal tides are a source of clean, free, renewable, and sustainable energy	0
1520	Fossil fuels sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals	0
1521	There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, petroleum, and natural gas	0
1522	Another fossil fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas	0
1523	Heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating, or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles, industrial processes, or electrical power generation	0
1524	Greenhouse gas emissions result from fossil fuel-based electricity generation	0
1525	Currently governments subsidize fossil fuels by an estimated $500 billion a year	0
1526	Nuclear power stations use nuclear fission to generate energy by the reaction of uranium-235 inside a nuclear reactor	0
1527	The reactor uses uranium rods, the atoms of which are split in the process of fission, releasing a large amount of energy	0
1528	The process continues as a chain reaction with other nuclei	0
1529	The energy heats water to create steam, which spins a turbine generator, producing electricity	0
1530	Depending on the type of fission fuel considered, estimates for existing supply at known usage rates varies from several decades for the currently popular Uranium-235 to thousands of years for uranium-238	0
1531	At the present rate of use, there are (as of 2007) about 70 years left of known uranium-235 reserves economically recoverable at a uranium price of US$ 130/kg	0
1532	The nuclear industry argue that the cost of fuel is a minor cost factor for fission power, more expensive, more difficult to extract sources of uranium could be used in the future, such as lower-grade ores, and if prices increased enough, from sources such as granite and seawater	0
1533	Increasing the price of uranium would have little effect on the overall cost of nuclear power; a doubling in the cost of natural uranium would increase the total cost of nuclear power by 5 percent	0
1534	On the other hand, if the price of natural gas was doubled, the cost of gas-fired power would increase by about 60 percent	0
1535	Opponents on the other hand argue that the correlation between price and production is not linear, but as the ores' concentration becomes smaller, the difficulty (energy and resource consumption are increasing, while the yields are decreasing) of extraction rises very fast, and that the assertion that a higher price will yield more uranium is overly optimistic; for example a rough estimate predicts that the extraction of uranium from granite will consume at least 70 times more energy than what it will produce in a reactor	0
1536	As many as eleven countries have depleted their uranium resources, and only Canada has mines left that produce better than 1% concentration ore	0
1537	Seawater seems to be equally dubious as a source	0
1538	Nuclear meltdowns and other reactor accidents, such as the Fukushima I nuclear accident (2011), Three Mile Island accident (1979) and the Chernobyl disaster (1986), have caused much public concern	0
1539	Research is being done to lessen the known problems of current reactor technology by developing automated and passively safe reactors	0
1540	Historically, however, coal and hydropower power generation have both been the cause of more deaths per energy unit produced than nuclear power generation	0
1541	Nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear technology which may happen from nation to nation or through other black market channels, including nuclear power plants and related technology including nuclear weapons	0
1542	The long-term radioactive waste storage problems of nuclear power have not been solved	0
1543	Several countries have considered using underground repositories	0
1544	Nuclear waste takes up little space compared to wastes from the chemical industry which remain toxic indefinitely	0
1545	Spent fuel rods are now stored in concrete casks close to the nuclear reactors	0
1546	The amounts of waste could be reduced in several ways	0
1547	Both nuclear reprocessing and breeder reactors could reduce the amounts of waste	0
1548	Subcritical reactors or fusion reactors could greatly reduce the time the waste has to be stored	0
1549	Subcritical reactors may also be able to do the same to already existing waste	0
1550	The only long-term way of dealing with waste today is by geological storage	0
1551	At present, nuclear energy is in decline, according to a 2007 World Nuclear Industry Status Report presented by the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament	0
1552	The report outlines that the proportion of nuclear energy in power production has decreased in 21 out of 31 countries, with five fewer functioning nuclear reactors than five years ago	0
1553	There are currently 32 nuclear power plants under construction or in the pipeline, 20 fewer than at the end of the 1990s	0
1554	Thorium can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor	0
1555	A thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle including much greater abundance on Earth, superior physical and nuclear properties of the fuel, enhanced proliferation resistance, and reduced nuclear waste production	0
1556	Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), has worked on developing the use of thorium as an alternative to uranium in reactors	0
1557	Rubbia states that a tonne of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tonnes of uranium, or 3,500,000 tonnes of coal	0
1558	One of the early pioneers of the technology was U.S. physicist Alvin Weinberg at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, who helped develop a working nuclear plant using liquid fuel in the 1960s	0
1559	Fusion power could solve many of the problems of fission power (the technology mentioned above) but, despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050	0
1560	Many technical problems remain unsolved	0
1561	Proposed fusion reactors commonly use deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, as fuel and in most current designs also lithium	0
1562	Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the current global output and that this does not increase in the future, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years, lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years	0
1563	The following chart does not include the external, weather-related costs of using fossil fuels	0
1564	Large energy subsidies are present in many countries (Barker et al., 2001:567-568)	0
1565	Currently governments subsidize fossil fuels by $557 billion per year	0
1566	Economic theory indicates that the optimal policy would be to remove coal mining and burning subsidies and replace them with optimal taxes	0
1567	Global studies indicate that even without introducing taxes, subsidy and trade barrier removal at a sectoral level would improve efficiency and reduce environmental damage	0
1568	Removal of these subsidies would substantially reduce GHG emissions and stimulate economic growth	0
1569	Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called energy efficiency, is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services	0
1570	For example, insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature	0
1571	Installing fluorescent lights or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional incandescent light bulbs	0
1572	Compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights	0
1573	Improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process	0
1574	There are various motivations to improve energy efficiency	0
1575	Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology	0
1576	Reducing energy use is also seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing emissions	0
1577	According to the International Energy Agency, improved energy efficiency in buildings, industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases	0
1578	Energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy policy	0
1579	In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate at which domestic energy resources are depleted	0
1580	While new sources of energy are only rarely discovered or made possible by new technology, distribution technology continually evolves	0
1581	The use of fuel cells in cars, for example, is an anticipated delivery technology	0
1582	This section presents some of the more common delivery technologies that have been important to historic energy development	0
1583	They all rely in some way on the energy sources listed in the previous section	0
1584	Shipping is a flexible delivery technology that is used in the whole range of energy development regimes from primitive to highly advanced	0
1585	Currently, coal, petroleum and their derivatives are delivered by shipping via boat, rail, or road	0
1586	Petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered via pipeline and coal via a Slurry pipeline	0
1587	Refined hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and LPG may also be delivered via aircraft	0
1588	Natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly	0
1589	Ethanol's corrosive properties make it harder to build ethanol pipelines	0
1590	The higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive	0
1591	Electricity grids are the networks used to transmit and distribute power from production source to end user, when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away	0
1592	Sources include electrical generation plants such as a nuclear reactor, coal burning power plant, etc	0
1593	A combination of sub-stations, transformers, towers, cables, and piping are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity	0
1594	Grids may suffer from transient blackouts and brownouts, often due to weather damage	0
1595	During certain extreme space weather events solar wind can interfere with transmissions	0
1596	Grids also have a predefined carrying capacity or load that cannot safely be exceeded	0
1597	When power requirements exceed what's available, failures are inevitable	0
1598	To prevent problems, power is then rationed	0
1599	Industrialised countries such as Canada, the US, and Australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world, which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network	0
1600	The US grid is one of the most advanced, although infrastructure maintenance is becoming a problem	0
1601	provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for California, Texas, and the Northeast of the US. African countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity	0
1602	One of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of Queensland, Australia	0
1603	Methods of energy storage have been developed, which transform electrical energy into forms of potential energy	0
1604	A method of energy storage may be chosen on the basis of stability, ease of transport, ease of energy release, or ease of converting free energy from the natural form to the stable form	0
1605	Some natural forms of energy are found in stable chemical compounds such as fossil fuels	0
1606	Most systems of chemical energy storage result from biological activity, which store energy in chemical bonds	0
1607	Man-made forms of chemical energy storage include hydrogen fuel, synthetic hydrocarbon fuel, batteries and explosives such as cordite and dynamite	0
1608	Dams can be used to store energy, by using pumped-storage hydroelectricity, excess energy to pump water into the reservoir	0
1609	When electrical energy is required, the process is reversed	0
1610	The water then turns a turbine, generating electricity	0
1611	Hydroelectric power is currently an important part of the world's energy supply, generating one-fifth of the world's electricity	0
1612	There are several technologies to store heat	0
1613	Thermal energy from the sun, for example, can be stored in a reservoir or in the ground for daily or seasonal use	0
1614	Thermal energy for cooling can be stored in ice	0
1615	Many thermal power plants are set up near coal or oil fields	0
1616	The thermal power plant is used since fuel is burnt to produce heat energy, which is converted into electrical energy	0
1617	Energy may also be stored in pressurized gases or alternatively in a vacuum	0
1618	Compressed air, for example, may be used to operate vehicles and power tools	0
1619	Large-scale compressed air energy storage facilities are used to smooth out demands on electricity generation by providing energy during peak hours and storing energy during off-peak hours	0
1620	All storage systems save on generating capacity since primary energy sources only need to meet average consumption rather than peak consumption	0
1621	A critical factor in design of compressed-air storage systems is the heat evolved during compression; a large amount of heat is given off when gases are compressed, and subsequent expansion requires the gas to resorb this heat	0
1622	In spite of the large cyclic efficiency loss in simple schemes, compressed air storage has still been applied in electrical grid applications, where low-cost off-peak baseload energy can be stored for later release during peaks	0
1623	Electrical energy may be stored in capacitors	0
1624	Capacitors are often used to produce high intensity releases of energy (such as a camera's flash)	0
1625	Hydrogen can be manufactured at roughly 77 percent thermal efficiency by the method of steam reforming of natural gas	0
1626	When manufactured by this method it is a derivative fuel like gasoline; when produced by electrolysis of water, it is a form of chemical energy storage as are storage batteries, though hydrogen is the more versatile storage mode since there are two options for its conversion to useful work: (1) a fuel cell can convert the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water, and in the process, produce electricity, or (2) hydrogen can be burned (less efficiently than in a fuel cell) in an internal combustion engine	0
1627	Petroleum, coal and natural gas are used to power most transportation and buildings	0
1628	Main articles: battery, battery electric vehicle Batteries are used to store energy in a chemical form	0
1629	As an alternative energy, batteries can be used to store energy in battery electric vehicles	0
1630	Battery electric vehicles can be charged from the grid when the vehicle is not in use	0
1631	Because the energy is derived from electricity, battery electric vehicles make it possible to use other forms of alternative energy such as wind, solar, geothermal, nuclear, or hydroelectric	0
1632	Compressed air vehicles would be propelled entirely or partly by energy stored in compressed air	0
1633	However, cyclic efficiency is low since it is difficult to store the heat of compression and return it to the air during expansion	0
1634	Certain specialized vehicles, for example, mine locomotives, have been built and used for many years	0
1635	The environmental movement emphasizes sustainability of energy use and development	0
1636	Renewable energy is sustainable in its production; the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years	1
1637	"Sustainability" also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products, especially air pollution	0
1638	Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are seen as ideal in this regard	0
1639	Fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas are not renewable	0
1640	For example, the timing of worldwide peak oil production is being actively debated but it has already happened in some countries	0
1641	Fossil fuels also make up the bulk of the world's current primary energy sources	0
1642	With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt alternative energy sources is also growing	0
1643	Fossil fuels are also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to concerns about global warming if consumption is not reduced	0
1644	Energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development	0
1645	It reduces the demand for energy by using it more efficiently	0
1646	Some observers contend that the much talked about idea of "energy independence" is an unrealistic and opaque concept	0
1647	They offer "energy resilience" as a more sensible goal and more aligned with economic, security and energy realities	0
1648	The notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security	0
1649	The authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would be no more secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the United States	0
1650	Key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to major disruption	0
1651	They conclude that a "resilient energy supply" is necessary for both national security and the environment	0
1652	They recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is more decentralized	0
1653	More recently former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove has touted energy resilience, arguing that complete independence is infeasible given the global market for energy	0
1654	He describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy	0
1655	To this end he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity	0
1656	Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources	0
1657	A diverse energy supply will be less impacted by the disruption in supply of any one source	0
1658	He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is "sticky" - meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is more likely to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas	0
1659	According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered	0
1660	This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid	0
1661	As organizations such as the Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries	0
1662	Extrapolations from current knowledge to the future offer a choice of energy futures	0
1663	Some predictions parallel the Malthusian catastrophe hypothesis	0
1664	Numerous are complex models based scenarios as pioneered by Limits to Growth	0
1665	Modeling approaches offer ways to analyze diverse strategies, and hopefully find a road to rapid and sustainable development of humanity	0
1666	Short term energy crises are also a concern of energy development	0
1667	Some extrapolations lack plausibility, particularly when they predict a continual increase in oil consumption	0
1668	Energy production usually requires an energy investment	0
1669	Drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy	0
1670	The fossil fuel resources (see above) that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert	0
1671	They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments	0
1672	If the investment is greater than the energy produced, then the fossil resource is no longer an energy source	0
1673	This means that a large part of the fossil fuel resources and especially the non-conventional ones cannot be used for energy production today	0
1674	Such resources may still be exploited economically in order to produce raw materials for plastics, fertilizers or even transportation fuel but now more energy is consumed than produced	0
1675	(They then become similar to ordinary mining reserves, economically recoverable but not net positive energy sources.) New technology may ameliorate this problem if it can lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded	0
1676	Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation	0
1677	The peaking of world hydrocarbon production (peak oil) may lead to significant changes, and require sustainable methods of production.	0
1678	The environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power	0
1679	This power is normally generated at power plants that convert some other kind of energy into electrical power	0
1680	Each system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns	0
1681	The amount of water usage is often of great concern for electricity generating systems as populations increase and droughts become a concern	0
1682	Still, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, thermoelectric power generation accounts for only 3.3 percent of net freshwater consumption with over 80 percent going to irrigation	0
1683	Likely future trends in water consumption are covered here	0
1684	General numbers for fresh water usage of different power sources are shown below	0
1685	  Water usage (gal/MW-h) . |- Power source Low case Medium/Average case High case  . |- Nuclear power 400 (once-through cooling) 400 to 720 (pond cooling) 720 (cooling towers) . |- Coal 300 480  . |- Natural gas 100 (once-through cycle) 180 (with cooling towers) . |- Hydroelectricity 1,430  . |- Solar thermal 1,060  . |- Geothermal 1,800 4,000  . |- Biomass 300 480  . |- Solar photovoltaic 30  . |- Wind power .5 1 2.2 .   Steam-cycle plants (nuclear, coal, NG, solar thermal) require a great deal of water for cooling, to remove the heat at the steam condensors	0
1686	The amount of water needed relative to plant output will be reduced with increasing boiler temperatures	0
1687	Coal- and gas-fired boilers can produce high steam temperatures and so are more efficient, and require less cooling water relative to output	0
1688	Nuclear boilers are limited in steam temperature by material constraints, and solar is limited by concentration of the energy source	0
1689	Thermal cycle plants near the ocean have the option of using seawater	0
1690	Such a site will not have cooling towers and will be much less limited by environmental concerns of the discharge temperature since dumping heat will have very little effect on water temperatures	0
1691	This will also not deplete the water available for other uses	0
1692	Nuclear power in Japan for instance, uses no cooling towers at all because all plants are located on the coast	0
1693	If dry cooling systems are used, significant water from the water table will not be used	0
1694	Other, more novel, cooling solutions exist, such as sewage cooling at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station	0
1695	Hydroelectricity's main cause of water usage is both evaporation and seepage into the water table	0

1706	Most electricity today is generated by burning fossil fuels and producing steam which is then used to drive a steam turbine that, in turn, drives an electrical generator	0
1707	Such systems allow electricity to be generated where it is needed, since fossil fuels can readily be transported	0
1708	They also take advantage of a large infrastructure designed to support consumer automobiles	0
1709	The world's supply of fossil fuels is large, but finite	0
1710	Exhaustion of low-cost fossil fuels will have significant consequences for energy sources as well as for the manufacture of plastics and many other things	0
1711	Various estimates have been calculated for exactly when it will be exhausted (see Peak oil)	0
1712	New sources of fossil fuels keep being discovered, although the rate of discovery is slowing while the difficulty of extraction simultaneously increases	0
1713	More serious are concerns about the emissions that result from fossil fuel burning	0
1714	Fossil fuels constitute a significant repository of carbon buried deep underground	0
1715	Burning them results in the conversion of this carbon to carbon dioxide, which is then released into the atmosphere	0
1716	The estimated CO2 emission from the world's electrical power industry is 10 billion tonnes yearly	0
1717	This results in an increase in the Earth's levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming	0
1718	The linkage between increased carbon dioxide and global warming is well accepted, though fossil-fuel producers vigorously contest these findings	0
1719	Depending on the particular fossil fuel and the method of burning, other emissions may be produced as well	0
1720	Ozone, sulfur dioxide, NO2 and other gases are often released, as well as particulate matter	0
1721	Sulfur and nitrogen oxides contribute to smog and acid rain	0
1722	In the past, plant owners addressed this problem by building very tall flue-gas stacks, so that the pollutants would be diluted in the atmosphere	0
1723	While this helps reduce local contamination, it does not help at all with global issues	0
1724	Fossil fuels, particularly coal, also contain dilute radioactive material, and burning them in very large quantities releases this material into the environment, leading to low levels of local and global radioactive contamination, the levels of which are, ironically, higher than a nuclear power station as their radioactive contaminants are controlled and stored	0
1725	Coal also contains traces of toxic heavy elements such as mercury, arsenic and others	0
1726	Mercury vaporized in a power plant's boiler may stay suspended in the atmosphere and circulate around the world	0
1727	While a substantial inventory of mercury exists in the environment, as other man-made emissions of mercury become better controlled, power plant emissions become a significant fraction of the remaining emissions	0
1728	Power plant emissions of mercury in the United States are thought to be about 50 tons per year in 2003, and several hundred tons per year in China	0
1729	Power plant designers can fit equipment to power stations to reduce emissions	0
1730	According to Environment Canada: "The electricity sector is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues	0
1731	Electricity generation produces a large share of Canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions, which contribute to smog and acid rain and the formation of fine particulate matter	0
1732	It is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in Canada	0
1733	Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit carbon dioxide, which may contribute to climate change	0
1734	In addition, the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species	0
1735	In particular, hydro dams and transmission lines have significant effects on water and biodiversity." .   Coal mining practices in the United States have also included strip mining and removing mountain tops	0
1736	Mill tailings are left out bare and have been leached into local rivers and resulted in most or all of the rivers in coal producing areas to run red year round with sulfuric acid that kills all life in the rivers	0
1737	The efficiency of some of these systems can be improved by cogeneration and geothermal (combined heat and power) methods	0
1738	Process steam can be extracted from steam turbines	0
1739	Waste heat produced by thermal generating stations can be used for space heating of nearby buildings	0
1740	By combining electric power production and heating, less fuel is consumed, thereby reducing the environmental effects compared with separate heat and power systems	0
1741	Nuclear power plants do not burn fossil fuels and so do not directly emit carbon dioxide; because of the high energy yield of nuclear fuels, the carbon dioxide emitted during mining, enrichment, fabrication and transport of fuel is small when compared with the carbon dioxide emitted by fossil fuels of similar energy yield	0
1742	A large nuclear power plant may reject waste heat to a natural body of water; this can result in undesirable increase of the water temperature with adverse effect on aquatic life	0
1743	Emission of radioactivity from a nuclear plant is controlled by regulations	0
1744	Abnormal operation may result in release of radioactive material on scales ranging from minor to severe, although these scenarios are very rare	0
1745	Mining of uranium ore can disrupt the environment around the mine	0
1746	Disposal of spent fuel is controversial, with many proposed long-term storage schemes under intense review and criticism	0
1747	Diversion of fresh or spent fuel to weapons production presents a risk of nuclear proliferation	0
1748	Finally, the structure of the reactor itself becomes radioactive and will require decades of storage before it can be economically dismantled and in turn disposed of as waste	0
1749	Development of large-scale hydroelectric power has environmental impacts associated with the change in water flow and the impoundment of water in a reservoir	0
1750	Dams may block the passage of fish	0
1751	The natural flow of silt down the river will be interrupted, affecting downstream ecosystems	0
1752	Where large reservoirs are not cleared of trees before flooding, the methane gas released by decaying wood can be comparable in greenhouse effect to the CO2 emissions of a fossil-fuel plant of similar output	0
1753	The filling of large reservoirs can induce earth tremors, which may be large enough to be objectionable or destructive	0
1754	For example, the 1967 Koynanagar earthquake of 6.9 magnitude was created after the filling of the Koyna Dam in India, with 180 fatalities	0
1755	A magnitude 7.9 earthquake near the Zipingpu Dam, China, in 2004, with 70,000 fatalities may also have been triggered by the weight of the reservoir	0
1756	In regions such as the Bay of Fundy with very large tidal swings, tidal power plants can be built to extract electrical power from the tidal motion	0
1757	Tidal power is also renewable, in the sense that it will continue for as long as the Moon orbits the Earth	0
1758	However, it has environmental problems similar to those of hydroelectric power	0
1759	A tidal power plant usually requires a large dam, which can endanger ecosystems by restricting the motion of marine animals	0
1760	Perhaps more seriously, a tidal power plant reduces or increases the tidal swing, which can severely disrupt ecosystems which depend on being periodically covered by water; resulting changes in fisheries or shellfish beds may result in adverse economic effects	0
1761	Certain proposed tidal power plants in the Bay of Fundy would increase the tidal swing by an estimated 50&nbsp;cm as far south as the coast of Maine (where the tidal swing is not particularly large now)	0
1762	Electrical power can be generated by burning anything which will combust	0
1763	Some electrical power is generated by burning crops which are grown specifically for the purpose	0
1764	Usually this is done by fermenting plant matter to produce ethanol, which is then burned	0
1765	This may also be done by allowing organic matter to decay, producing biogas, which is then burned	0
1766	Also, when burned, wood is a form of biomass fuel	0
1767	Burning biomass produces many of the same emissions as burning fossil fuels	0
1768	However, growing biomass captures carbon dioxide out of the air, so that the net contribution to global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is lessened	0
1769	The process of growing biomass is subject to the same environmental concerns as any kind of agriculture	0
1770	It uses a large amount of land, and fertilizers and pesticides may be necessary for cost-effective growth	0
1771	Biomass that is produced as a by-product of agriculture shows some promise, but most such biomass is currently being used, for plowing back into the soil as fertilizer if nothing else	0
1772	Wind power harnesses mechanical energy from the constant flow of air over the surface of the earth	0
1773	Wind power stations generally consist of wind farms, fields of wind turbines in locations with relatively high winds	0
1774	A primary publicity issue regarding wind turbines are their older predecessors, such as the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California	0
1775	These older, smaller, wind turbines are rather noisy and densely located, making them very unattractive to the local population	0
1776	The downwind side of the turbine does disrupt local low-level winds	0
1777	Modern large wind turbines have mitigated these concerns, and have become a commercially important energy source	0
1778	Many homeowners in areas with high winds and expensive electricity set up small windmills to reduce their electric bills	0
1779	A modern wind farm, when installed on agricultural land, has one of the lowest environmental impacts of all energy sources:  It occupies less land area per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated than any other renewable energy conversion system, and is compatible with grazing and crops	1
1780	It generates the energy used in its construction within just months of operation	0
1781	Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution produced by its construction are small and declining	0
1782	There are no emissions or pollution produced by its operation	1
1783	Modern wind turbines rotate so slowly (in terms of revolutions per minute) that they are rarely a hazard to birds	0
1784	Landscape and heritage issues may be a significant issue for certain wind farms	0
1785	However, when appropriate planning procedures are followed, the heritage and landscape risks should be minimal	0
1786	Some people may still object to wind farms, perhaps on the grounds of aesthetics, but there is still the supportive opinions of the broader community and the need to address the threats posed by climate change	0
1787	Geothermal energy is the heat of the Earth, which can be tapped into to produce electricity in power plants	0
1788	Warm water produced from geothermal sources can be used for industry, agriculture, bathing and cleansing	0
1789	Where underground steam sources can be tapped, the steam is used to run a steam turbine	0
1790	Geothermal steam sources have a finite life as underground water is depleted	0
1791	Arrangements that circulate surface water through rock formations to produce hot water or steam are, on a human-relevant time scale, renewable	0
1792	While a geothermal power plant does not burn any fuel, it will still have emissions due to substances other than steam which come up from the geothermal wells	0
1793	These may include hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide	0
1794	Some geothermal steam sources entrain non-soluble minerals that must be removed from the steam before it is used for generation; this material must be properly disposed	0
1795	Any (closed cycle) steam power plant requires cooling water for condensers; diversion of cooling water from natural sources, and its increased temperature when returned to streams or lakes, may have a significant impact on local ecosystems	0
1796	Removal of ground water and accelerated cooling of rock formations can cause earth tremors	0
1797	Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) fracture underground rock to produce more steam; such projects can cause earthquakes	0
1798	Certain geothermal projects ( such as one near Basel, Switzerland in 2006) have been suspended or canceled owing to objectionable seismicity induced by geothermal recovery	0
1799	However, risks associated with "hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes, and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring" and "should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the Hot Rock geothermal energy resource"	0
1800	Currently solar photovoltaic power is used primarily in Germany and Spain where the governments offer financial incentives	0
1801	In the U.S., Washington State also provides financial incentives	0
1802	Photovoltaic power is also more common, as one might expect, in areas where sunlight is abundant	0
1803	It works by converting the sun's radiation into direct current (DC) power by use of photovoltaic cells	0
1804	This power can then be converted into the more common AC power and fed to the power grid	0
1805	Solar photovoltaic power offers a viable alternative to fossils fuels for its cleanliness and supply, although at a high production cost	0
1806	Future technology improvements are expected to bring this cost down to a more competitive range	0
1807	Its negative impact on the environment lies in the creation of the solar cells which are made primarily of silica (from sand) and the extraction of silicon from silica may require the use of fossil fuels, although newer manufacturing processes have eliminated CO2 production	0
1808	Solar power carries an upfront cost to the environment via production, but offers clean energy throughout the lifespan of the solar cell	0
1809	Large scale electricity generation using photovoltaic power requires a large amount of land, due to the low power density of photovoltaic power	0
1810	Land use can be reduced by installing on buildings and other built up areas, though this reduces efficiency	0
1811	Also known as Solar thermal, this technology uses various types of mirrors to concentrate sunlight and produce heat	0
1812	This heat is used to generate electricity in a standard Rankine cycle turbine	0
1813	Like most thermoelectric power generation, this consumes water	0
1814	This can be a problem, as solar powerplants are most commonly located in a desert environment due to the need for sunlight and large amounts of land	0
1815	Many concentrated solar systems also use exotic fluids to absorb and collect heat while remaining at low pressure	0
1816	These fluids could be dangerous if spilled	0
1817	Negawatt power refers to investment to reduce electricity consumption rather than investing to increase supply capacity	0
1818	In this way investing in Negawatts can be considered as an alternative to a new power station and the costs and environmental concerns can be compared	0
1819	Negawatt investment alternatives to reduce consumption by improving efficiency include:  Providing customers with energy efficient lamps - low environmental impact  Improved thermal insulation and airtightness for buildings - low environmental impact  Replacing older industrial plant - low environmental impact	0
1820	Can have a positive impact due to reduced emissions	0
1821	Negawatt investment alternatives to reduce peak electrical load by time shifting demand include;  Storage heaters - older systems had asbestos	0
1822	Newer systems have low environmental impact	0
1823	Demand response control systems where the electricity board can control certain customer loads - minimal environmental impact  Thermal storage systems such as Ice storage systems to make ice during the night and store it to use it for air conditioning during the day - minimal environmental impact  Pumped storage hydroelectricity - Can have a significant environmental impact - see hydroelectricity	0
1824	other Grid energy storage technologies - impact varies	0
1825	Note that time shifting does not reduce total energy consumed or system efficiency however it can be used to avoid the need to build a new power station to cope with a peak load.	0
1826	An intermittent energy source is any source of energy that is not continuously available due to some factor outside direct control	0
1827	The intermittent source may be quite predictable, for example, tidal power, but cannot be dispatched to meet the demand of a power system	0
1828	Effective use of intermittent sources in an electric power grid usually relies on using the intermittent sources to displace fuel that would otherwise be consumed by non-renewable power stations, or by storing energy in the form of renewable pumped storage, compressed air or ice, for use when needed, or as electrode heating for district heating schemes	0
1829	The storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies is part of a reliable energy supply	0
1830	The capacity of a reliable renewable energy supply, can additionally be fulfilled by the use of latency measures and backup or extra infrastructure and technology, using mixed renewables to produce electricity above the intermittent average, which may be utilised to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands	0
1831	The penetration of intermittent renewables in most power grids is low, but wind generates 11% of electric energy in Spain and Portugal, 9% in the Republic of Ireland, and 7% in Germany	0
1832	Wind provides nearly 20% of the electricity generated in Denmark, however this percentage forces Denmark to import and export large amounts of energy to and from the EU grid, to balance supply with demand	0
1833	The use of small amounts of intermittent power has little effect on grid operations	0
1834	Using larger amounts of intermittent power may require upgrades or even a redesign of the grid infrastructure	0
1835	Several key terms are useful for understanding the issue of intermittent power sources	0
1836	These terms are not standardized, and variations may be used	0
1837	Most of these terms also apply to traditional power plants	0
1838	Intermittency can mean the extent to which a power source is unintentionally stopped or unavailable, but intermittency is frequently used as though it were synonymous with variability	0
1839	Variability is the extent to which a power source may exhibit undesired or uncontrolled changes in output	0
1840	Dispatchability or maneuverability is the ability of a given power source to increase and/or decrease output quickly on demand	0
1841	The concept is distinct from intermittency; maneuverability is one of several ways grid operators match output (supply) to system demand	0
1842	Nominal or nameplate capacity, or maximum effect refers to the normal maximum output of a generating source	0
1843	This is the most common number used and is typically expressed in megawatts (MW)	0
1844	Capacity factor, average capacity factor, or load factor is the average expected output of a generator, usually over an annual period	0
1845	Expressed as a percentage of the nameplate capacity or in decimal form (e.g	0
1846	30% or 0.30)	0
1847	Capacity credit: generally, the amount of output from a power source that may be statistically relied upon, expressed as a percentage	0
1848	Penetration in this context is generally used to refer to the amount of energy generated as a percentage of annual consumption	0
1849	Firm capacity the amount of power that can be guaranteed to be provided as base power Non-firm capacity the amount of power above the firm capacity that is usually to be sold at higher price on the spot market .  Intermittency inherently affects solar energy, as the production of electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of light energy in a given location	0
1850	Solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons, and is affected by cloud cover	0
1851	These factors are fairly predictable, and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce power when the sun is not shining	0
1852	Intermittency: In the absence of an energy storage system, solar does not produce power at night	0
1853	Capacity factor Photovoltaic solar in Massachusetts 12-15%. Photovoltaic solar in Arizona 19% Thermal solar parabolic trough 56% Thermal solar power tower 73% The extent to which the intermittency of solar-generated electricity is an issue will depend to some extent on the degree to which the generation profile of solar corresponds to demand	0
1854	For example, solar thermal power plants such as Nevada Solar One are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States	0
1855	Thermal energy storage systems can improve the degree of match between supply and consumption	0
1856	The increase in capacity factor of thermal systems does not represent an increase in efficiency, but rather a spreading out of the time over which the system generates power	0
1857	Wind-generated power is a variable resource, and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds, air density, and turbine characteristics (among other factors)	1
1858	If wind speed is too low (less than about 2.5&nbsp;m/s) then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity, and if it is too high (more than about 25&nbsp;m/s) the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage	0
1859	While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable	0
1860	Intermittence: A single wind turbine is highly intermittent	0
1861	Theoretical arguments often claim that a large wind farm spread over a geographically diverse area will as a whole rarely stop producing power altogether, however this is in contradiction to the observed variability in total power output of wind turbines installed in Ireland and Denmark	0
1862	Capacity Factor: Wind power typically has a capacity factor of 20-40%. Dispatchability: Wind power is "highly non-dispatchable"	1
1863	Capacity Credit: At low levels of penetration, the capacity credit of wind is about the same as the capacity factor	0
1864	As the concentration of wind power on the grid rises, the capacity credit percentage drops	0
1865	Variability: Site dependent	0
1866	Sea breezes are much more constant than land breezes	0
1867	Reliability: A wind farm is highly reliable (although highly intermittent)	1
1868	That is, the output at any given time will only vary gradually due to falling wind speeds or storms (the latter necessitating shut downs)	0
1869	A typical wind farm is unlikely to have to shut down in less than half an hour at the extreme, whereas an equivalent sized power station can fail totally instantaneously and without warning	0
1870	The total shut down of wind turbines is predictable via weather forecasting	0
1871	According to a study of wind in the United States, ten or more widely-separated wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47% of their average output (15-20% of nominal capacity) as reliable, baseload power, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height	0
1872	When calculating the generating capacity available to meet peak demand, [ERCOT] (manages Texas grid) counts wind generation at 8.7% of nameplate capacity	0
1873	Because wind power is generated by large numbers of small generators, individual failures do not have large impacts on power grids	0
1874	This feature of wind has been referred to as resiliency	0
1875	Wind power is affected by air temperature because colder air is more dense and therefore more effective at producing wind power	0
1876	As a result, wind power is affected seasonally (more output in winter than summer) and by daily temperature variations	0
1877	During the 2006 California heat storm output from wind power in California significantly decreased to an average of 4% of capacity for 7 days	0
1878	A similar result was seen during the 2003 European heat wave, when the output of wind power in France, Germany, and Spain fell below 10% during peak demand times	0
1879	According to an article in EnergyPulse, "the development and expansion of well-functioning day-ahead and real time markets will provide an effective means of dealing with the variability of wind generation." .  Nuclear power plants are intermittent in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly, often for long periods of time	0
1880	For example, in the United States, 132 nuclear plants were built, and 21% were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems, while another 27% have at least once completely failed for a year or more	0
1881	The remaining U.S. nuclear plants produce approximately 90% of their full-time full-load potential, but even they must shut down (on average) for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance	0
1882	To cope with such intermittence by nuclear (and centralized fossil-fuelled) power plants, utilities install a "reserve margin" of roughly 15% extra capacity spinning ready for instant use	0
1883	Nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage; for safety, they must instantly shut down in a power failure, but for nuclear-physics reasons, they can't be restarted quickly	0
1884	For example, during the Northeast Blackout of 2003, nine operating U.S. nuclear units had to shut down and were later restarted	0
1885	During the first three days, while they were most needed, their output was less than 3% of normal	0
1886	After twelve days of restart, their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent	0
1887	The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with despatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet our needs reliably	0
1888	Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world:  In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids"	0
1889	In Fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the International Energy Agency, has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more	0
1890	Mark Z. Jacobson has studied how wind, water and solar technologies can be integrated to provide the majority of the world's energy needs	0
1891	He advocates a "smart mix" of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand: Because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind, combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand, especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps	0
1892	Mark A. Delucchi and Mark Z. Jacobson argue that there are at least seven ways to design and operate renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand: .   (A) interconnect geographically-dispersed naturally-variable energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, wave, tidal), which smooths out electricity supply (and demand) significantly	0
1893	(B) use complementary and non-variable energy sources (such as hydroelectric power) to fill temporary gaps between demand and wind or solar generation	0
1894	(C) use "smart" demand-response management to shift flexible loads to a time when more renewable energy is available	0
1895	(D) store electric power, at the site of generation, (in batteries, hydrogen gas, compressed air, pumped hydroelectric power, and flywheels), for later use	0
1896	(E) over-size renewable peak generation capacity to minimize the times when available renewable power is less than demand and to provide spare power to produce hydrogen for flexible transportation and heat uses	0
1897	(F) store electric power in electric-vehicle batteries, known as "vehicle to grid" or V2G.  (G) forecast the weather (winds, sunlight, waves, tides and precipitation) to better plan for energy supply needs	0
1898	Technological solutions to mitigate large scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection (the European super grid), Demand response, load management, diesel generators (in National Grid), Frequency Response / National Grid Reserve Service type schemes, and use of existing power stations on standby	0
1899	Studies by academics and grid operators indicate that the cost of compensating for intermittency is expected to be high at levels of penetration above the low levels currently in use today Large, distributed power grids are better able to deal with high levels of penetration than small, isolated grids	0
1900	For a hypothetical European-wide power grid, analysis has shown that wind energy penetration levels as high as 70% are viable, and that the cost of the extra transmission lines would be only around 10% of the turbine cost, yielding power at around present day prices	0
1901	Smaller grids may be less tolerant to high levels of penetration	0
1902	Matching power demand to supply is not a problem specific to intermittent power sources	0
1903	Existing power grids already contain elements of uncertainty including sudden and large changes in demand and unforeseen power plant failures	0
1904	Though power grids are already designed to have some capacity in excess of projected peak demand to deal with these problems, significant upgrades may be required to accommodate large amounts of intermittent power	0
1905	The International Energy Agency (IEA) states: "In the case of wind power, operational reserve is the additional generating reserve needed to ensure that differences between forecast and actual volumes of generation and demand can be met	0
1906	Again, it has to be noted that already significant amounts of this reserve are operating on the grid due to the general safety and quality demands of the grid	0
1907	Wind imposes additional demands only inasmuch as it increases variability and unpredictability	0
1908	However, these factors are nothing completely new to system operators	0
1909	By adding another variable, wind power changes the degree of uncertainty, but not the kind.." .  A November 2006 analysis found that "wind power may be able to cover more than 50% of the Danish electricity consumption in 2025" under conditions of high oil prices and higher costs for CO2 allowances	0
1910	Denmark's two grids (covering West Denmark and East Denmark separately) each incorporate high-capacity interconnectors to neighbouring grids where some of the variations from wind are absorbed	0
1911	Many commentators concentrate on whether or not wind has any "capacity credit" without defining what they mean by this and its relevance	0
1912	Wind does have a capacity credit, using a widely accepted and meaningful definition, equal to about 20% of its rated output (but this figure varies depending on actual circumstances)	0
1913	This means that reserve capacity on a system equal in MW to 20% of added wind could be retired when such wind is added without affecting system security or robustness	0
1914	UK academic commentator Graham Sinden, of Oxford University, argues that this issue of capacity credit is a "red herring" in that the value of wind generation is largely due to the value of displaced fuel, not any perceived capacity credit - it being well understood by the wind energy proponents that conventional capacity will be retained to "fill in" during periods of low or no wind	0
1915	The main value of wind, (in the UK, 5 times the capacity credit value) is its fuel and CO2 savings	0
1916	Wind does not require any extra back-up, as is often wrongly claimed, since it uses the existing power stations, which are already built, as back-up, and which are started up during low wind periods, just as they are started up now, during the non availability of other conventional plant	0
1917	More spinning reserve, of existing plant, is required, but this again is already built and has a low cost comparatively	0
1918	Hydroelectric power is usually extremely dispatchable and more reliable than other renewable energy sources	0
1919	Many dams can provide hundreds of megawatts within seconds of demand (see Ffestiniog power station)	0
1920	The exact nature of the power availability depends on the type of plant	0
1921	In run-of-the-river hydroelectricity, power availability is highly dependent on the flow of the river, making this type of generation mostly suitable only at locations where flow levels are controlled by upstream dams	0
1922	In conventional hydroelectric plants, there is a reservoir and a one-way generator	0
1923	The water flow through its turbines can be adjusted frequently to meet changing demand throughout the day by running the generator when demand is high and not running it when demand is low	0
1924	Pumped-storage hydroelectricity can make an even more significant contribution to peaking ability of the grid	0
1925	These just move water between reservoirs and are powered by power from the grid when demand is low and put power back into the grid when demand is high	0
1926	There also exist combined pump-storage plants that use river flow as well as extra pumping when demand is low, such as the 240 MW Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant	0
1927	Direct pumped-storage does not contribute any net generation to the grid, in fact, it increases the fuel used by other power plants because there is inefficiency in the turbine/generator	0
1928	The economic benefit of pumped-storage plants lies only in increasing the capacity of the grid	0
1929	This type of plant works well on a grid with many nuclear or renewable energy plants because the fuel is very cheap or essentially free, so it costs very little to keep them running at high power during the night when demand is low	0
1930	Both pump-storage plants and natural flow hydro plants can help allow for intermittency of other plants by running at higher capacity for short times, but assistance is limited by the total capacity of the hydroelectric plant	0
1931	Once a conventional power station has come offline it may stay that way for more than a week	0
1932	Conventional power plants (as well as nuclear plants) use water for cooling, and water shortages during hot summer months have occasionally resulted in periods when output has had to be curtailed, notably in France in 2006	0
1933	Conventional power plant failures can remove large amounts of capacity from the grid suddenly, resulting in blackouts	0
1934	Capacity factor: Base load coal plant 70-90% .  Gas-fired plants are typically very reliable and dispatchable	0
1935	These kinds of plants also often have the ability to quickly vary their output to adjust to the frequent jumps and changes in consumer demand	0
1936	Thus these are very good as peaking units	0
1937	These benefits are weighted against the high price of gas when deployed in the grid	0
1938	Capacity factor: about 60%.  Nuclear power is considered a base load power source, in that its output is nearly constant and other types of plants are adjusted with changes in demand	0
1939	This is done because output changes can only be made in small increments, and because of small fuel costs - there is little marginal cost between running at a low power and a high power, therefore it is cheapest for the system to run the nuclear plants at high power	0
1940	Every year or two (depending on the plant), the plant must be shut down for planned outages for about a month	0
1941	This is typically done in the spring or autumn (fall) when electricity demand is lower, as such, on a national scale power output from nuclear increases corresponding with demand during the peak summer and winter months	0
1942	This change in output commonly occurs on a yearly basis	0
1943	It is rare that nuclear power plants adjust their power output to correspond with demand on a daily basis because pressurized water reactors (PWR, which are the vast majority of nuclear power plants) use a chemical shim in the moderator-coolant to control their power level	0
1944	(Boiling water reactors (BWR), however, can use a combination of control rods and recirculation water flow speed to control their power level, and so in markets such as Chicago, Illinois where half of the local utility's fleet is BWRs it is common to load-follow although less economic to do so.) .   Intermittence: Unplanned outages worldwide caused power losses varying from 3.1% and 1.4% of capacity between 1995 and 2005	0
1945	Over that same period reactors worldwide encountered an average of 1.1 to 0.6 SCRAMs per 7,000 hours critical (about a year of operation.) An automatic SCRAM is a protective measure that shuts the reactor down suddenly for safety reasons	0
1946	Capacity factor: U.S. average 92%. Worldwide average varied between about 81% to 87% between 1995 and 2005	0
1947	In the UK one of the key criteria for determining the amount of required spinning reserve is the possible loss of Sizewell B, a 1.2 GW nuclear power plant	0
1948	At one point in the fall of 2007, out of 16 nuclear power stations in the UK, seven were offline due to a combination of planned and unplanned outages	0
1949	Small high-speed diesels are very commonly used within large power grids throughout North America and Europe	0
1950	France uses about 5 GW of such diesels to cover the intermittency of their nuclear stations; these are all in private hands - at small scales factories and the like - with their usage being triggered semi-randomly by a special tariff -- which encourages these users to start their diesels	0
1951	In USA and UK these diesels have usually been purchased for other reasons e.g	0
1952	for emergency standby, in water works, hotels, hospitals, etc	0
1953	and in some cases for electricity substations - e.g	0
1954	Cuyahoga Falls, USA (10 × 1.6 MW Caterpillar) and Tregarron Mid Wales UK (3 × 1.6 MW Caterpillar), but can be readily used to automatically synchronize and feed into the grid	0
1955	In the UK 500 MW of such plant is routinely started within a few minutes; this is perfectly acceptable to the engines' service life in a scheme operated by National Grid called National Grid Reserve Service	0
1956	It has been established that there is 20 GW of such diesel plant in the UK and it has been pointed out that there is no technical reason why this quantity could not be brought into the Reserve Service scheme to assist handling very rapid changes in renewable output, whilst conventional plant is started or indeed stopped	0
1957	.  All sources of electrical power have some degree of unpredictability, and demand patterns routinely drive large swings in the amount of electricity that suppliers feed into the grid	0
1958	Wherever possible, grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability, and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed	0
1959	The introduction of large amounts of highly variable power generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments	0
1960	All managed grids already have existing operational and "spinning" reserve to compensate for existing uncertainties in the power grid	0
1961	The addition of intermittent resources such as wind does not require 100% "back-up" because operating reserves and balancing requirements are calculated on a system-wide basis, and not dedicated to a specific generating plant	0
1962	Some coal, gas, or hydro power plants are partially loaded and then controlled to change as demand changes or to replace rapidly lost generation	0
1963	The ability to change as demand changes is termed "response." The ability to quickly replace lost generation, typically within timescales of 30 seconds to 30 minutes, is termed "spinning reserve." Generally thermal plants running as peaking plants will be less efficient than if they were running as base load	0
1964	Hydroelectric facilities with storage capacity (such as the traditional dam configuration) may be operated as base load or peaking plants	0
1965	In practice, as the power output from wind varies, partially loaded conventional plants, which are already present to provide response and reserve, adjust their output to compensate	1
1966	While low penetrations of intermittent power may utilize existing levels of response and spinning reserve, the larger overall variations at higher penetrations levels will require additional reserves or other means of compensation	0
1967	Demand response refers to the use of communication and switching devices which can release deferrable loads quickly, or absorb additional energy to correct supply/demand imbalances	0
1968	Incentives have been widely created in the American, British and French systems for the use of these systems, such as favorable rates or capital cost assistance, encouraging consumers with large loads to take them off line or to start diesels whenever there is a shortage of capacity, or conversely to increase load when there is a surplus	0
1969	Certain types of load control allow the power company to turn loads off remotely if insufficient power is available	0
1970	In France large users such as CERN cut power usage as required by the System Operator - EDF under the encouragement of the EJP tariff	0
1971	Energy demand management refers to incentives to adjust use of electricity, such as higher rates during peak hours	0
1972	Real-time variable electricity pricing can encourage users to adjust usage to take advantage of periods when power is cheaply available and avoid periods when it is more scarce and expensive	0
1973	Instantaneous demand reduction	0
1974	Most large systems also have a category of loads which instantly disconnect when there is a generation shortage, under some mutually beneficial contract	0
1975	This can give instant load reductions (or increases)	0
1976	See National Grid Reserve Service .   Diesel generators, originally or primarily installed for emergency power supply are often also connected to the National Grid in the UK to help deal with short term demand supply mismatches	0
1977	At times of low or falling demand where wind output may be high or increasing, grid stability may require lowering the output of various generating sources or even increasing demand, possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand	0
1978	Such mechanisms can include:  Pumped storage hydropower is the most prevalent existing technology used, and can substantially improve the economics of wind power	0
1979	The availability of hydropower sites suitable for storage will vary from grid to grid	0
1980	Typical round trip efficiency is 80%. See also: Pumped-storage hydroelectricity Thermal energy storage stores heat	0
1981	Stored heat can be used directly for heating needs or converted into electricity	0
1982	Ice storage air conditioning Ice can be stored inter seasonally and can be used as a source of air-conditioning during periods of high demand	0
1983	Present systems only need to store ice for a few hours but are well developed	0
1984	Hydrogen can be created through electrolysis and stored for later use	0
1985	NREL found that a kilogram of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to a gallon of gasoline) could be produced for between $5.55 in the near term and $2.27 in the long term	0
1986	Rechargeable flow batteries can serve as a large capacity, rapid-response storage medium	0
1987	Main article: Flow batteries Some loads such as desalination plants and electric boilers, are able to store their output (water and heat.) These "opportunistic loads" are able to take advantage of "burst electricity" when it is available	0
1988	Various other potential applications are being considered, such as charging plug-in electric vehicles during periods of low demand and high production; such technologies are not widely used at this time	0
1989	Storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient	0
1990	Storage may also require substantial capital investment and space for storage facilities	0
1991	The variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high	0
1992	Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, as long as the correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine	0
1993	Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability	0
1994	Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system	1
1995	Multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations	0
1996	Wind output can be predicted with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts, especially from large numbers of turbines/farms	0
1997	The ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected, especially from newer facilities	0
1998	Electricity produced from solar energy could be a counter balance to the fluctuating supplies generated from wind	0
1999	In some locations, it tends to be windier at night and during cloudy or stormy weather, so there is likely to be more sunshine when there is less wind	0
2000	In some locations, electricity demand may have a high correlation with wind output, particularly in locations where cold temperatures drive electric consumption (as cold air is denser and carries more energy)	0
2001	The allowable penetration may be further increased by increasing the amount of part-loaded generation available	0
2002	Systems with existing high levels of hydroelectric generation may be able to incorporate substantial amounts of wind, although high hydro penetration may indicate that hydro is already a low-cost source of electricity; Norway, Quebec, and Manitoba all have high levels of existing hydroelectric generation (Quebec produces over 90% of its electricity from hydropower, and the local utility, Hydro-Québec, is the largest single hydropower producer in the world)	0
2003	The US Pacific Northwest has been identified as another region where wind energy is complemented well by existing hydropower, and there were "no fundamental technical barriers" to integrating up to 6,000 MW of wind capacity	0
2004	Storage capacity in hydropower facilities will be limited by size of reservoir, and environmental and other considerations	0
2005	The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel, Germany pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock, entirely from renewable sources	0
2006	It is often feasible to export energy to neighboring grids at times of surplus, and import energy when needed	0
2007	This practice is common in Western Europe and North America	0
2008	Integration with other grids can lower the effective concentration of variable power	0
2009	Denmark's 44% penetration, in the context of the German/Dutch/Scandinavian grids with which it has interconnections, is considerably lower as a proportion of the total system	0
2010	This effect is diminished if more neighboring grids also have high penetration levels of variable power	0
2011	Integration of grids may decrease the overall variability of both supply and demand by increasing geographical diversity	0
2012	Methods of compensating for power variability in one grid, such as peaking-plants or pumped-storage hydro-electricity, may be taken advantage of by importing variable power from another grid that is short on such capabilities	0
2013	The capacity of power transmission infrastructure may have to be substantially upgraded to support export/import plans	0
2014	Some energy is lost in transmission	0
2015	The economic value of exporting variable power depends in part on the ability of the exporting grid to provide the importing grid with useful power at useful times for an attractive price	0
2016	Penetration refers to the proportion of a power source on a system, expressed as a percentage	0
2017	There are several ways that this can be calculated, with the different methods yielding different penetrations	0
2018	It can be calculated either as:  the nominal capacity of a power source divided by peak demand; or  the nominal capacity of a power source divided by total capacity; or  the average power generated by a power source, divided by the average system demand	0
2019	The level of penetration of intermittent variable sources is significant for the following reasons:  Power grids with significant amounts pumped storage, hydropower or other peaking power plants such as natural gas-fired power plants are more inherently capable of accommodating fluctuations from intermittent power	0
2020	Isolated, relatively small systems with only a few wind plants may only be stable and economic with a lower fraction of wind energy (e.g	0
2021	Ireland), although mixed wind/diesel systems have been used in isolated communities with success at relatively high penetration levels	0
2022	Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of a integrated European grid system:  In 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs	0
2023	Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year)	0
2024	The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind	0
2025	Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity	0
2026	There is no generally accepted maximum level of penetration, as each system's capacity to compensate for intermittency differs, and the systems themselves will change over time	0
2027	Discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution, as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors, grid structure and management, and existing generation capacity	0
2028	For most systems worldwide, existing penetration levels are significantly lower than practical or theoretical maximums; for example, a UK study found that "it is clear that intermittent generation need not compromise electricity system reliability at any level of penetration foreseeable in Britain over the next 20 years, although it may increase costs." .  There is no generally accepted maximum penetration of wind energy that would be feasible in any given grid	0
2029	Rather, economic efficiency and cost considerations are more likely to dominate as critical factors; technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels to be considered in future, particularly if cost considerations are secondary	0
2030	High penetration scenarios may be feasible in certain circumstances: .   Power generation for periods of little or no wind generation can be provided by retaining the existing power stations	0
2031	The cost of using existing power stations for this purpose may be low since fuel costs dominate the operating costs	0
2032	The actual cost of paying to keep a power station idle, but usable at short notice, may be estimated from published spark spreads and dark spreads	0
2033	As existing traditional plant ages, the cost of replacing or refurbishing these facilities will become part of the cost of high-penetration wind if they are used only to provide operational reserve	0
2034	Automatic load shedding of large industrial loads and its subsequent automatic reconnection is established technology and used in the UK and US, and known as Frequency Service contractors in the UK. Several GW are switched off and on each month in the UK in this way	0
2035	Reserve Service contractors offer fast response gas turbines and even faster diesels in the UK, France and US to control grid stability	0
2036	In a close-to-100% wind scenario, surplus wind power can be allowed for by increasing the levels of the existing Reserve and Frequency Service schemes and by extending the scheme to domestic-sized loads	0
2037	Energy can be stored by advancing deferrable domestic loads such as storage heaters, water heaters, fridge motors, or even hydrogen production, and load can be shed by turning such equipment off	0
2038	Alternatively or additionally, power can be exported to neighboring grids and re-imported later	0
2039	HVDC cables are efficient with 3% loss per 1000 km and may be inexpensive in certain circumstances	0
2040	For example an 8 GW link from UK to France would cost about £1 billion using high-voltage direct current cables	0
2041	Under such scenarios, the amount of transmission capacity required may be many times higher than currently available	0
2042	Studies have been conducted to assess the viability of specific penetration levels in specific energy markets	0
2043	A series of detailed modelling studies by Dr	0
2044	Gregor Czisch, which looked at the European wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids the European super grid using HVDC cables, indicates that the entire European power usage could come from renewables, with 70% total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present	0
2045	This proposed large European power grid has been called a "super grid." .   The model deals with intermittent power issues by using base-load renewables such as hydroelectric and biomass for a substantial portion of the remaining 30% and by heavy use of HVDC to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas	0
2046	The report states that "electricity transport proves to be one of the keys to an economical electricity supply" and underscores the importance of "international co-operation in the field of renewable energy use [and] transmission." .   Dr	0
2047	Czisch described the concept in an interview, saying "For example, if we look at wind energy in Europe	0
2048	We have a winter wind region where the maximum production is in winter and in the Sahara region in northern Africa the highest wind production is in the summer and if you combine both, you come quite close to the needs of the people living in the whole area - let's say from northern Russia down to the southern part of the Sahara." .  A study of the grid in Ireland indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42% (of demand) renewables  in the electricity mix	0
2049	This acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called Scenario 5, provided 47% of electrical capacity (different from demand) with the following mix of renewable energies:  6,000 MW wind  360 MW base load renewables  285 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources) .   The study cautions that various assumptions were made that "may have understated dispatch restrictions, resulting in an underestimation of operational costs, required wind curtailment, and CO2 emissions" and that "The limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed.." .   Scenario 6, which proposed renewables providing 59% of electrical capacity and 54% of demand had problems	0
2050	Scenario 6 proposed the following mix of renewable energies:  8,000 MW wind  392 MW base load renewables  1,685 MW additional variable renewables (other intermittent sources) The study found that for Scenario 6, "a significant number of hours characterized by extreme system situations occurred where load and reserve requirements could not be met	0
2051	The results of the network study indicated that for such extreme renewable penetration scenarios, a system re-design is required, rather than a reinforcement exercise." The study declined to analyze the cost effectiveness of the required changes because "determination of costs and benefits had become extremely dependent on the assumptions made" and this uncertainty would have impacted the robustness of the results	0
2052	A study published in October, 2006, by the Ontario Independent Electric System Operator (IESO) found that "there would be minimal system operation impacts for levels of wind capacity up to 5,000 MW," which corresponds to a peak penetration of 17% .  Estimates of the cost of wind energy may include estimates of the "external" costs of wind variability, or be limited to the cost of production	0
2053	All electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production, including, for example, the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity	0
2054	Many types of generation, particularly fossil fuel derived, will also have cost externalities such as pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for	0
2055	The magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location, but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels	0
2056	At low penetration levels, costs such as operating reserve and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant	0
2057	Intermittency may introduce additional costs that are distinct from or of a different magnitude than for traditional generation types	0
2058	These may include:  Transmission capacity: transmission capacity may be more expensive than for nuclear and coal generating capacity due to lower load factors	0
2059	Transmission capacity will generally be sized to projected peak output, but average capacity for wind will be significantly lower, raising cost per unit of energy actually transmitted	0
2060	However transmission costs are a low fraction of total energy costs	0
2061	Additional operating reserve: if additional wind does not correspond to demand patterns, additional operating reserve may be required compared to other generating types, however this does not result in higher capital costs for additional plants since this is merely existing plants running at low output - spinning reserve	0
2062	Contrary to statements that all wind must be backed by an equal amount of "back-up capacity", intermittent generators contribute to base capacity "as long as there is some probability of output during peak periods." Back-up capacity is not attributed to individual generators, as back-up or operating reserve "only have meaning at the system level." Balancing costs: to maintain grid stability, some additional costs may be incurred for balancing of load with demand	1
2063	The ability of the grid to balance supply with demand will depend on the rate of change of the amount of energy produced (by wind, for example) and the ability of other sources to ramp production up or scale production down	0
2064	Balancing costs have generally been found to be low	0
2065	Storage, export and load management: at high penetrations (more than 30%), solutions (described below) for dealing with high output of wind during periods of low demand may be required	0
2066	These may require additional capital expenditures, or result in lower marginal income for wind producers	0
2067	Studies have been performed to determine the costs of variability	0
2068	RenewableUK states: .   "A review of integration studies, worldwide, suggests that the additional costs of integrating wind are around £2/MWh with 10% wind, rising to £3/MWh with 20% wind." .  An official at Xcel Energy claimed that at 20 percent penetration, additional standby generators to compensate for wind in Colorado would cost $8 per MWh, adding between 13% and 16% to the $50-$60 cost per MWh of wind energy	0
2069	The Union of Concerned Scientists conducted a study of the costs to increase the renewable penetration in Colorado to 10% and found that for an average residential bill "customers of municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives that opt out of the solar energy requirement" would save 4 cents per month, but that for Xcel Energy customers there would be additional cost of about 10 cents per month	0
2070	Total impact on all consumers would be $4.5 million or 0.01% over two decades	0
2071	A detailed study for UK National Grid (a private power company) states "We have estimated that for the case with 8,000 MW of wind needed to meet the 10% renewables target for 2010, balancing costs can be expected to increase by around £2 per MWh of wind production	0
2072	This would represent an additional £40million per annum, just over 10% of existing annual balancing costs." .   In evidence to the UK House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee, National Grid have quoted estimates of balancing costs for 40% wind and these lie in the range £500-1000M per annum	0
2073	"These balancing costs represent an additional £6 to £12 per annum on average consumer electricity bill of around £390." .   National Grid notes that "increasing levels of such renewable generation on the system would increase the costs of balancing the system and managing system frequency." .   A 2003 report by Carbon Trust and the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) found that the costs for reinforcement and new build of transmission and distribution systems to support 10% renewable electricity in the UK by 2010 would be £1.6 to £2.4 billion	0
2074	The study classified "Intermittency" as "Not a significant issue" for the 2010 target	0
2075	The same 2003 study found that achieving 20% renewable electricity in the UK by 2020 would cost £3.2bn to £4.5bn in transmission and distribution system construction and reinforcement	0
2076	The study classified "Intermittency" as a "Significant Issue" for the 2020 target	0
2077	Minnesota study on wind penetration levels and found that "total integration operating cost for up to 25% wind energy" would be less than $0.0045 per kWh (additional)	0
2078	There are differing views about some sources of renewable energy and intermittency	0
2079	The World Nuclear Association argues that the sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power when it is needed	0
2080	Proponents of renewable energy use argue that the issue of intermittency of renewables is over-stated, and that practical experience demonstrates this	0
2081	In any case, geothermal renewable energy has no intermittency	0
2082	The World Nuclear Association states that: "Obviously sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power when it is needed,.." "In practical terms non-hydro renewables are therefore able to supply up to some 15-20% of the capacity of an electricity grid, though they cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for most coal or nuclear power, however significant they become in particular areas with favourable conditions." "If the fundamental opportunity of these renewables is their abundance and relatively widespread occurrence, the fundamental challenge, especially for electricity supply, is applying them to meet demand given their variable and diffuse nature	0
2083	This means either that there must be reliable duplicate sources of electricity beyond the normal system reserve, or some means of electricity storage." "Relatively few places have scope for pumped storage dams close to where the power is needed, and overall efficiency is less than 80%. Means of storing large amounts of electricity as such in giant batteries or by other means have not been developed."  .   On December 10, 2007 Patrick Moore, co-chair of the Clean & Safe Energy Coalition - a pro-nuclear group funded by the Nuclear Energy Institute - wrote: "Greenpeace is deliberately misleading the public into thinking that wind and solar energy, both of which are inherently intermittent and unreliable, can replace baseload power that is continuous and reliable	0
2084	Only three technologies can produce large amounts of baseload power: fossil fuels, hydroelectric plants and nuclear power	0
2085	Given that we want to reduce fossil fuels and that potential hydroelectric sites are becoming scarce, nuclear power is the main option.. Over the past 10 years, Germany and Denmark have poured billions of taxpayers' euros into wind and solar energy in the vain hope that this would allow them to shut down fossil fuel and nuclear plants	0
2086	They have not succeeded because every solar panel and every wind turbine must be backed up by reliable power when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing." Mr	1
2087	Moore is a co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace, but he has not been involved with Greenpeace since 1986	0
2088	The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stated that "baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism" and that no new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the United States	0
2089	This however is a minority viewpoint within President Obama's administration which via expanded federal loan guarantees in the proposed 2011 budget is supporting a nuclear renaissance	0
2090	Australian researchers at the University of New South Wales claim to have solved the energy storage problem for solar and wind power with the development of vanadium redox batteries	0
2091	(U.S. patent issued in 1986)	0
2092	Some renewable electricity sources have identical variability to coal-fired power stations, so they are base-load, and can be integrated into the electricity supply system without any additional back-up	0
2093	Examples include: .   Bio-energy, based on the combustion of crops and crop residues, or their gasification followed by combustion of the gas	0
2094	Hot dry rock geothermal power, which is being developed in Australia and the United States	0
2095	Solar thermal electricity, with overnight heat storage in water or rocks, or a thermochemical store as with Nevada Solar One and Solar Tres	0
2096	Furthermore, supporters argue that the total electricity generated from a large-scale array of dispersed wind farms, located in different wind regimes, cannot be accurately described as intermittent, because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals	0
2097	With a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant, which operates infrequently, large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable	0
2098	Hydropower can be intermittent and/or dispatchable, depending on the configuration of the plant	0
2099	Typical hydroelectric plants in the dam configuration may have substantial storage capacity, and be considered dispatchable	0
2100	Run of the river hydroelectric generation will typically have limited or no storage capacity, and will be variable on a seasonal or annual basis (dependent on rainfall and snow melt)	0
2101	Amory Lovins suggests a few basic strategies to deal with these issues: .   ""The variability of sun, wind and so on, turns out to be a non-problem if you do several sensible things	0
2102	One is to diversify your renewables by technology, so that weather conditions bad for one kind are good for another	0
2103	Second, you diversify by site so they're not all subject to the same weather pattern at the same time because they're in the same place	0
2104	Third, you use standard weather forecasting techniques to forecast wind, sun and rain, and of course hydro operators do this right now	0
2105	Fourth, you integrate all your resources&nbsp;— supply side and demand side.."" .   Moreover, efficient energy use and energy conservation measures can reliably reduce demand for base-load and peak-load electricity	0
2106	Several studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility of integrating intermittent power at levels substantially higher than is common in most countries (from 15-30% penetration), and at least three countries have more than 20% wind penetration	0
2107	Relatively few changes to large grids are normally required and the associated system costs are moderate	0
2108	International groups are studying much higher penetrations (30-75%, corresponding to up to 20% of national electricity consumption) and preliminary conclusions are that these levels are also technically feasible	0
2109	In the UK, one summary of other studies indicated that if assuming that wind power contributed less than 20% of UK power consumption, then the intermittency would cause only moderate cost	0
2110	Methods to manage wind power integration range from those that are commonly used at present (e.g	0
2111	demand management) to potential new technologies for grid energy storage	0
2112	Improved forecasting can also contribute as the daily and seasonal variations in wind and solar sources are to some extent predictable	0
2113	The Pembina Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature state in the Renewable is Doable plan that resilience is a feature of renewable energy: .   "Diversity and dispersal also add system security	0
2114	If one wind turbine fails, the lights won't flicker	0
2115	If an entire windfarm gets knocked out by a storm, only 40,000 people will lose power	0
2116	If a single Darlington reactor goes down, 400,000 homes, or key industries, could face instant blackouts	0
2117	To hedge this extra risk, high premiums have to be paid for decades to ensure large blocks of standby generation." .	0
2118	.   A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electric power	0
2119	A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes	0
2120	A wind farm may also be located offshore	0
2121	Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA. As of November 2010, the Roscoe Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the world, with a capacity of 781.5 MW of power, followed by the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center (735.5 MW)	0
2122	As of February 2012, the Walney Wind Farm in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 MW, followed by Thanet Offshore Wind Project (300 MW), also in the UK.   There are many large wind farms under construction and these include Anholt Offshore Wind Farm (400 MW), BARD Offshore 1 (400 MW), Clyde Wind Farm (548 MW), Greater Gabbard wind farm (500 MW), Lincs Wind Farm (270 MW), London Array (1000 MW), Lower Snake River Wind Project (343 MW), Macarthur Wind Farm (420 MW), Shepherds Flat Wind Farm (845 MW), and Sheringham Shoal (317 MW)	0
2123	A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes	0
2124	A wind farm may be located offshore to take advantage of strong winds blowing over the surface of an ocean or lake	0
2125	As a general rule, economic wind generators require windspeed of 10&nbsp;mph (16&nbsp;km/h) or greater	0
2126	An ideal location would have a near constant flow of non-turbulent wind throughout the year, with a minimum likelihood of sudden powerful bursts of wind	0
2127	An important factor of turbine siting is also access to local demand or transmission capacity	0
2128	Usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas, and validated with wind measurements	0
2129	Meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project	0
2130	Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential in order to finance the project	0
2131	Local winds are often monitored for a year or more, and detailed wind maps constructed before wind generators are installed	0
2132	The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag	0
2133	The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings	0
2134	Typically, the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a wind profile power law, which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude	0
2135	Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10% and the expected power by 34%.   Individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) power collection system and communications network	0
2136	At a substation, this medium-voltage electrical current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system	0

2180	In 2006, the British government gave planning consent for the world's largest offshore wind farm, the 'London Array'	0
2181	It is currently being built 12 miles off of the Kent coast and will include 341 turbines when finished	0
2182	An important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms	1
2183	In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing	0
2184	To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "supergrid" to connect national grids together across western Europe, ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world	0
2185	The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland	0
2186	Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere	0

2211	Wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for defense, weather and air traffic control	1
2212	The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern	0
2213	Actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected, as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that	0
2214	But aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task	0
2215	The US military is using wind turbines on some bases, including Barstow near the radar test facility	0
2216	The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar	0
2217	An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity	0
2218	Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning	0
2219	Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration	0
2220	Radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 MW of projects in USA.   Some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms	0

2225	In early 2011, the U.S. government awarded a program to build a radar/wind turbine analysis tool	0
2226	This tool will allow developers to predict the impact of a wind farm on a radar system before construction, thus allowing rearrangement of the turbines or even the entire wind farm to avoid negative impacts on the radar system	0
2227	A mobile radar system, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77, has shown in recent tests that it can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines, and more than 170 TPS-77 radars are in use around the world	0
2228	In Britain, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77 will be delivered and installed in November 2011 at Trimingham in Norfolk, removing military objections to a series of offshore wind farms in the North Sea	0
2229	A second TPS-77 is to be installed in the Scottish Borders, overcoming objections to a 48-turbine wind farm at Fallago	0
2230	The professor of atmospheric science Somnath Baidya Roy of the University of Illinois, in a study published in October 2010 in the scientific journal PNAS shows that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas	0
2231	According to Roy, the effect is due to the turbulence generated by the blades	0
2232	In another study conducted by Gene Takle and Julie Lundquist University of Colorado, presented at San Francisco conference of the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (December 13-18, 2010), the analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the United States has noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the spring and autumn frosts, and it reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves	0
2233	Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5-3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of maize.	0
2234	Wind power in Australia is a proven and reliable technology that can be and is readily deployed	1

Making comparisons between wind and other sources of energy can be difficult because of the cost profiles associated with wind developments	0
2257	The vast majority of the costs associated with wind developments are upfront capital costs	0
2258	The operating costs are relatively low, with each additional unit of wind power costing very little to produce	1
2259	By comparison, conventional gas and coal developments have large capital costs, as well as significant operating costs	0
2260	The difference in cost profiles creates difficulties when trying to compare the cost of alternative energy sources	0
2261	Despite these complexities, most of the data indicate that wind energy is one of the most cost efficient sources of renewable energy and that when the costs associated with pollution are factored in it is competitive with coal- and gas-fired power stations	1
2262	Australia is the fifth highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases with 25.8 tonne CO2-e per person annually, ranking first of the industrialized countries, and ranks sixteenth of all countries in total country emissions with 495 Mt CO2-e per annum	0
2263	It is one of the major exporters of coal, the burning of which releases CO2 into the atmosphere	0
2264	It is also one of the countries most at risk from climate change according to the Stern report	0
2265	This is partially because of the size of its agriculture sector and long coastline	0
2266	A wind farm, when installed on agricultural land, has one of the lowest environmental impacts of all energy sources: .   It occupies less land area per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated than any other energy conversion system, apart from rooftop solar energy, and is compatible with grazing and crops	0
2267	It generates the energy used in its construction in just 3 months of operation, yet its operational lifetime is 20-25 years	0
2268	Greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution produced by its construction are small and declining	0
2269	There is very little emission or pollution produced by its operation	1
2270	In substituting for base-load (mostly coal power) in mainland Australia, wind power produces a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution	1
2271	Modern wind turbines are almost silent and rotate so slowly (in terms of revolutions per minute) that they are rarely a hazard to birds	0
2272	Landscape and heritage issues may be a significant issue for certain wind farms,however these are minimal when compared with the Environmental effects of coal	0
2273	However, when appropriate planning procedures are followed, the heritage and landscape risks should be minimal	0
2274	Some people may still object to wind farms, perhaps on the grounds of aesthetics, but their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community	0
2275	Overseas experience has shown that community consultation and direct involvement of the general public in wind farm projects has helped to increase community approval	0
2276	Some wind farms become tourist attractions	0
2277	The Garnaut Climate Change Review, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the Mandatory Renewable energy Target announced by the Australian Government involve a reduction in Australian greenhouse gas emissions	0
2278	Australia is the highest emitter of greenhouse gases per capita in the developed world and wind power is well placed to grow and deliver greenhouse gas emission cuts on a cost competitive basis	0
2279	A typical 50-megawatt (MW) wind farm in Australia can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 65,000 and 115,000&nbsp;tonnes a year	0
2280	.   Based on the 2010 figures for electricity production of 5 TWh nationally, it is estimated that wind power saved Australia 5,100,000&nbsp;tonnes of CO2 emissions in that year	0
2281	In relative terms, that is calculated to be the equivalent of removing 1,133,000 cars from the nation's roads	0
2282	From 2001 to early 2006, the main driving force for the establishment of wind farms in Australia was the Government's Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET)	0
2283	However, by mid-2006, sufficient renewable energy had been installed or was under construction to meet the small MRET target for 2010	0
2284	Also, in 2006, several Federal Government Ministers spoke out against a number of wind farm proposals	0
2285	Dr Mark Diesendorf has suggested that the Australian Government has tried to stop the development of wind power, the lowest-cost, new, renewable electricity source, until such time as coal-fired power stations with CO2 capture and sequestration and possibly nuclear power stations are available	0
2286	However, "clean coal" technologies may not be commercially available for at least 20 years	0
2287	Furthermore, to bring down the high cost of nuclear power to a level where it could compete with wind power would require a new generation of nuclear power stations that is still on the drawing board, which could take at least 15 years	0
2288	In November 2007 the Rudd (Labor) government was elected in Australia, replacing the Howard (Liberal/National Coalition) government	0
2289	The new government ratified Australia's commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, promised a target of 20% renewable power by 2020 and to do more to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions	0
2290	As a result, several new wind power projects have been proposed in anticipation of an expanded MRET.   In July 2011 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 4 Corners program explored health concerns connected with Australian wind farms in its "" report	0
2291	Meridian Energy is the largest electricity generator in New Zealand and has in recent years expanded into Australia	0
